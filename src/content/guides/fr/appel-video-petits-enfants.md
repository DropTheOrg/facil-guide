faq:
  - question: "Is video calling free?"
    answer: "Yes, if you're on Wi-Fi. On mobile data, it uses your data plan but most plans include enough data for video calls."
  - question: "Can they see me during the call?"
    answer: "Yes. Video calls go both ways -- you see them and they see you. If you prefer, you can turn off your camera during the call."
  - question: "What if the video is blurry?"
    answer: "This usually means your internet connection is slow. Try moving closer to your Wi-Fi router or switching to a stronger connection."

## Etape 1: Choisissez an app

The easiest options:
- **FaceTime** (iPhone to iPhone) -- already on your iPhone
- **WhatsApp** -- works on any phone, most people already have it
- **Google Meet** -- works in any web browser, no app needed

## Etape 2: Open the app

Tap the app on your home screen. Make sure you're connected to **Wi-Fi** for the best quality.

## Etape 3: Find the person you want to call

**FaceTime:** Tap the + button, type their name or number, then tap the video icon.

**WhatsApp:** Open the chat with the person and tap the **video camera icon** at the top right.

## Etape 4: Wait for them to answer

Votre telephone will ring on their end. When they answer, you'll see their face on your screen and they'll see yours. **Smile -- they can see you!**

## Etape 5: During the call

Hold your phone at **arm's length** with the front camera facing you. Speak normally -- the microphone picks up your voice clearly. To end the call, tap the red button.
