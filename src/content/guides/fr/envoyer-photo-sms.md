faq:
  - question: "Will sending a photo cost me money?"
    answer: "If you send a photo as an MMS (multimedia message), it may cost a small amount depending on your phone plan. If you send it through iMessage (iPhone to iPhone) or over Wi-Fi, it is usually free. Check your phone plan if you are unsure."
  - question: "Why is my photo blurry when I send it?"
    answer: "Text messages (MMS) compress photos to make them smaller. The photo may lose some quality. For higher quality, send photos through WhatsApp, email, or iMessage instead."
  - question: "Can I send more than one photo at a time?"
    answer: "Yes. In most messaging apps, you can tap the photo icon and select multiple photos before sending. On iPhone, tap each photo you want to include, then press send."
  - question: "What if the person says they did not receive my photo?"
    answer: "The photo may be too large for their phone to download, or their phone plan may not support MMS. Try sending it through WhatsApp or email instead."
