## What You Will Need

- A computer, tablet, or another phone with internet access
- Your Apple ID (iPhone) or Google account (Android) credentials

## Step 1: Use Another Device

Go to a computer or ask someone to lend you their phone or tablet.

Open a web browser and go to:

- **For iPhone:** [icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find)
- **For Android:** [google.com/android/find](https://www.google.com/android/find)

## Step 2: Sign In

Log in with the same account you use on your lost phone:

- **iPhone:** Enter your **Apple ID** email and password
- **Android:** Enter your **Google** email and password

## Step 3: Locate Your Phone on the Map

After signing in, you will see a map showing where your phone is (or where it was last seen).

- A **green dot** means the phone is online and its location is current
- A **gray dot** means the phone is offline, and the location is the last known position

## Step 4: Make Your Phone Ring

If your phone is nearby (maybe lost in the couch or another room):

- Click **Play Sound** (iPhone) or **Play Sound** (Android)
- Your phone will ring at full volume for 5 minutes, even if it is on silent mode

Listen for the sound and follow it to find your phone.

## Step 5: Lock or Erase (If Needed)

If you think your phone might be stolen or you cannot reach it:

- **Lock it:** Tap **Lost Mode** (iPhone) or **Secure Device** (Android). This locks your phone and displays a message with a phone number where you can be reached.
- **Erase it:** As a last resort, tap **Erase Phone** to delete all data remotely. Do this only if you are sure you will not get the phone back.

**Important:** After erasing, you can no longer track the phone.

## You Did It!

You now know how to find a lost phone. The best protection is to make sure **Find My Phone** is turned on before you lose it. Check it now: Settings > [your name] > Find My (iPhone) or Settings > Security > Find My Device (Android).
