## Step 1: Connect your phone to the computer

Plug your phone's charging cable into your phone and into a USB port on your computer. Your phone may ask you to trust this computer -- tap **Trust** or **Allow**.

## Step 2: Open the photos on your computer

**On Windows:** A notification may appear asking what to do. Click **Import photos**. Or open **File Explorer** and look for your phone under **This PC**.

**On Mac with iPhone:** The **Photos** app opens automatically. Click **Import All** to transfer all new photos.

**On Mac with Android:** Download the **Android File Transfer** app. Open it and navigate to the **DCIM** folder.

## Step 3: Select the photos you want

Browse through the photos. Select the ones you want to save to your computer. You can select all or just specific photos.

## Step 4: Copy to your computer

Drag the selected photos to a folder on your computer (like **Pictures** or **Desktop**). Or click **Import** if using the Photos app.

## Step 5: Verify and disconnect

Open the folder on your computer to make sure your photos are there. Once confirmed, safely disconnect your phone by unplugging the cable.
