    answer: "Yes. In the same Display settings, look for Display size or Screen zoom to make everything on screen larger, not just text."

## Étape 1 : Open Settings

Find the **Settings** app on your phone (the gear icon) and tap it to open.

## Étape 2 : Go to Display settings

Scroll down and tap **Display**. On some phones, this may be called **Display & Brightness**.

## Étape 3 : Find text size

Look for **Font size** or **Text size**. Tap on it. You will see a slider that controls how big or small the text appears.

## Étape 4 : Adjust the size

Drag the slider to the **right** to make text bigger. You will see a preview of how the text will look. Keep adjusting until you find a size that is comfortable for you. The change is applied immediately -- you do not need to save anything.
