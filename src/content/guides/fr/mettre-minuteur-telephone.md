faq:
  - question: "Can I set more than one timer at the same time?"
    answer: "On iPhone (iOS 17 and later), yes. You can run multiple timers at once. On older iPhones or most Android phones, you can usually only run one timer at a time, but you can set multiple alarms instead."
  - question: "Will the timer sound if my phone is on silent?"
    answer: "On iPhone, the timer will vibrate but not make a sound if your phone is on silent mode. If you want to hear the alarm, switch off silent mode using the switch on the side of your phone. On Android, timers usually sound even in silent mode."
  - question: "Can I use the timer without unlocking my phone?"
    answer: "Yes. You can ask Siri (iPhone) or Google Assistant (Android) to set a timer without touching your phone. Just say 'Set a timer for 10 minutes.'"
