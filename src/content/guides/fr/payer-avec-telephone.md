faq:
  - question: "Is paying with my phone safe?"
    answer: "Yes, it is very safe. Your actual card number is never shared with the store. The phone creates a unique code for each purchase. It is considered safer than using a physical card."
  - question: "Do all stores accept phone payments?"
    answer: "Most stores that accept contactless card payments also accept phone payments. Look for the contactless symbol (four curved lines) at the payment terminal."
  - question: "Do I need internet to pay?"
    answer: "No. Phone payments use NFC (a short-range wireless signal), not the internet. You can pay even without Wi-Fi or mobile data."
  - question: "What if my phone battery dies?"
    answer: "If your phone is completely out of battery, you cannot pay with it. Some newer iPhones have a Power Reserve feature that lets Apple Pay work for a few hours after the battery dies, but it is best to keep a backup payment method."
  - question: "Is there a limit on how much I can pay?"
    answer: "For small amounts, you just tap. For larger amounts (usually over 50 euros or pounds), you may need to confirm with Face ID, fingerprint, or your passcode. There is usually no maximum limit."

## Ce dont vous aurez besoin

- An iPhone (iPhone SE or newer) or Android phone with NFC
- A debit or credit card from a supported bank
- Face ID, Touch ID, or a screen lock set up on your phone

## Etape 1: Open the Wallet App

- **Sur iPhone :** Open the **Wallet** app (it looks like a wallet with cards inside)
- **Sur Android :** Open **Google Wallet** (or **Google Pay**). Download it from the Play Store if you do not have it.

## Etape 2: Add Your Card

Tap the **+** button to add a new card.

- **Sur iPhone :** Tap **Debit or Credit Card** > **Continue**. Hold your card in front of the camera to scan it, or type the card number manually.
- **Sur Android :** Tap **Add to Wallet** > **Payment card**. Scan the card with your camera or type the details.

Your bank may send you a verification code by SMS or ask you to open your banking app to approve.

## Etape 3: Verify Your Card

After adding the card, your bank needs to verify it is really yours.

- They may send a **code by SMS** -- enter it in the Wallet app
- Or they may ask you to **open your banking app** and approve there

Once verified, your card is ready to use.

## Etape 4: Pay at a Store

When you are at a checkout:

1. **Look for the contactless symbol** on the payment terminal (four curved lines, like a Wi-Fi symbol turned sideways)
2. **Unlock your payment:**
   - **Sur iPhone :** Double-press the **side button** and confirm with **Face ID** or **Touch ID**
   - **Sur Android :** Unlock your phone normally. Google Pay activates automatically when you hold your phone near the terminal.
3. **Hold the back of your phone** near the payment terminal (within 2-3 centimeters)
4. Wait for a **beep** or **vibration** and a checkmark on your screen

The payment is done.

## Etape 5: Check Your Receipt

After paying:

- A notification will appear on your phone showing the amount charged
- You can see all your payments in the Wallet app under your card

## Vous avez reussi !

You can now pay at any store that accepts contactless payments. It is faster than fumbling for your wallet, and safer than handing over your card.
