  - question: "What is the difference between a file and a folder?"
    answer: "A file is a single document, photo, or item. A folder is like a container that holds files and other folders, helping you organize them."
  - question: "Can I put a folder inside another folder?"
    answer: "Yes. This is very common and helps you stay organized. For example, you could have a Photos folder with subfolders for each year."
  - question: "What happens if I delete a folder?"
    answer: "Everything inside the folder will also be deleted. On most computers, deleted items go to the Trash or Recycle Bin first, so you can recover them if needed."

## Étape 1 : Open your file manager

On Windows, open **File Explorer** (the folder icon on your taskbar). On Mac, open **Finder** (the smiley face icon on your dock). This is where you can see all the files and folders on your computer.

## Étape 2 : Navigate to a location

Click on **Documents**, **Desktop**, or **Downloads** in the left sidebar. This takes you to common locations where files are stored. Click on any folder to open it and see what is inside.

## Étape 3 : Create a new folder

Right-click on an empty area and select **New Folder** (Windows) or **New Folder** (Mac). A new folder will appear. Type a name for it -- for example, "Family Photos" or "Important Documents" -- and press **Enter**.

## Étape 4 : Move files into a folder

To move a file, click on it once to select it. Then drag it (hold the left mouse button down while moving the mouse) and drop it onto the folder. Release the mouse button when the folder is highlighted. The file is now inside that folder.

## Étape 5 : Rename or delete files

To rename a file or folder, right-click on it and choose **Rename**. Type the new name and press Enter. To delete, right-click and choose **Delete** or **Move to Trash**. Remember: deleted items usually go to the Trash or Recycle Bin, where you can recover them if needed.
