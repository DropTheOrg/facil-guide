faq:
  - question: "Can I get deleted messages back?"
    answer: "On iPhone, recently deleted messages may be in the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days. On most Android phones, once deleted they are gone permanently."
  - question: "If I delete a message, does the other person still see it?"
    answer: "Yes. Deleting a message from your phone only removes it from your device. The other person's copy is not affected."
  - question: "How do I delete all messages at once?"
    answer: "In the Messages app, tap Edit (iPhone) or the three dots menu (Android), then select multiple conversations and delete them."
