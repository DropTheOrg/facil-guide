faq:
  - question: "Does using the flashlight drain my battery?"
    answer: "Yes, but slowly. Using the flashlight for a few minutes is fine. If you leave it on for a long time (more than 30 minutes), it will use noticeable battery. Turn it off when you no longer need it."
  - question: "Can I change how bright the flashlight is?"
    answer: "On iPhone, yes. Press and hold the flashlight icon in Control Center to see brightness options. On most Android phones, the flashlight has one brightness level, but some Samsung and Pixel phones let you adjust it."
  - question: "Why is my flashlight not working?"
    answer: "If the flashlight does not turn on, your battery might be very low (below 5%). Some phones also disable the flashlight while the camera is open. Close the camera app and try again."
  - question: "Will the flashlight turn off by itself?"
    answer: "No. The flashlight stays on until you turn it off manually. If your phone runs out of battery, the flashlight will turn off."
