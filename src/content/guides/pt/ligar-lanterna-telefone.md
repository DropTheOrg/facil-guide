## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone

## Step 1: Open the Quick Settings

You do not need to unlock your phone fully to use the flashlight.

- **On iPhone (with Face ID):** Swipe down from the **top-right corner** of the screen
- **On iPhone (with Home button):** Swipe **up** from the bottom of the screen
- **On Android:** Swipe **down** from the top of the screen with two fingers

This opens the Control Center (iPhone) or Quick Settings panel (Android).

## Step 2: Tap the Flashlight Icon

Look for the flashlight icon. It looks like a small torch or flashlight.

- **On iPhone:** Tap the **flashlight icon** (bottom-left area of Control Center)
- **On Android:** Look for the **Flashlight** or **Torch** tile in Quick Settings and tap it

The flashlight on the back of your phone will turn on immediately.

## Step 3: Turn It Off When Done

To turn off the flashlight, repeat the same steps:

1. Open Quick Settings or Control Center again
2. Tap the flashlight icon again

The icon will no longer be highlighted, and the light will turn off.

**Tip:** On iPhone, you can also ask **Siri**: say "Hey Siri, turn on my flashlight." Say the same command to turn it off.

## You Did It!

You now know how to use your phone as a flashlight. It works even in the dark, and you can turn it on without unlocking your phone.
