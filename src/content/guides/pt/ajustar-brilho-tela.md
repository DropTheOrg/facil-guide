## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone

## Step 1: Open Quick Settings

- **On iPhone:** Swipe down from the **top-right corner** of the screen (or up from the bottom on older models)
- **On Android:** Swipe down from the **top** of the screen

You will see quick settings icons and a brightness slider.

## Step 2: Drag the Brightness Slider

Look for the **brightness slider**. It looks like a bar with a sun icon.

- **Drag it to the right** to make the screen brighter
- **Drag it to the left** to make the screen dimmer

Adjust it until the screen is comfortable for your eyes.

## Step 3: Turn On Auto-Brightness (Optional)

If you want your phone to adjust brightness automatically:

- **On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Display & Text Size** > turn on **Auto-Brightness**
- **On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Display** > turn on **Adaptive Brightness**

With this turned on, your phone will get brighter outside and dimmer indoors, automatically.

## You Did It!

You can now adjust your screen brightness whenever you need to. Lower it at night to be easier on your eyes, and raise it outside so you can see clearly.
