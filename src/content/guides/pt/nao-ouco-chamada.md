  - question: "Why can I hear on speakerphone but not normally?"
    answer: "This usually means the small earpiece speaker at the top of your phone is blocked or damaged. Try cleaning it gently with a soft brush. If that does not work, the speaker may need repair."
  - question: "Could it be a problem with my phone network?"
    answer: "Yes. If you have poor signal, calls can sound muffled or silent. Try moving to a different location or near a window. If the problem only happens in one place, it is likely a signal issue."
  - question: "What if the other person says they cannot hear me?"
    answer: "That is a microphone problem, not a speaker problem. Make sure nothing is covering the bottom of your phone where the microphone is. Try removing your phone case temporarily."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn what to do when you cannot hear the other person during a phone call. This is a common problem with several easy fixes.

## What you need

- O seu telefone (iPhone or Android)

## The steps

### Passo 1: Check the volume

During a call, press the **Volume Up** button on the side of your phone several times. The volume may simply be turned down too low. You will see a volume bar appear on the screen as you press the button.

### Passo 2: Check if something is blocking the speaker

Look at the small **speaker opening at the top** of your phone (the earpiece). Make sure it is not covered by a phone case, screen protector, or dirt. Gently clean it with a soft, dry brush or cloth if needed.

Also check that you have not accidentally connected to **Bluetooth**. If your phone is sending audio to a Bluetooth device (like a car or headphones), you will not hear anything from the phone speaker. Go to **Definicoes** > **Bluetooth** and turn it off temporarily to test.

### Passo 3: Try speakerphone

During the call, tap the **Speaker** button on the call screen. This switches the audio to the loudspeaker at the bottom of your phone. If you can hear on speaker but not normally, the earpiece speaker may need cleaning or repair.

### Passo 4: Restart your phone

If the volume is fine and nothing is blocking the speaker, try restarting your phone. This fixes many temporary audio problems.

**No iPhone:** Press and hold the **Side button** and either **Volume button** until the power-off slider appears. Slide to turn off, wait 10 seconds, then press the **Side button** to turn it back on.

**No Android:** Press and hold the **Power button** and tap **Restart**.

### Passo 5: Check for software updates

An outdated system can sometimes cause audio problems. 

**No iPhone:** Go to **Definicoes** > **General** > **Software Update**. If an update is available, tap **Download and Install**.

**No Android:** Go to **Definicoes** > **System** > **Software Update**. If an update is available, install it.

### Passo 6: Test with a different call

After trying the steps above, make a test call to someone you know. If you still cannot hear them, try calling a different person to rule out the problem being on the other end. If the problem persists with everyone, your phone may need professional repair.

## Helpful tips

- **Clean regularly**: Dust and lint can build up in the earpiece over time. Clean it gently every few weeks with a soft brush.
- **Remove your case**: Some phone cases can partially block the earpiece. Try making a call without your case to see if it helps.
- **Try headphones**: If you plug in wired headphones or connect Bluetooth earbuds, you can use those for calls while you sort out the speaker problem.
- **Do Not Disturb**: Make sure **Do Not Disturb** mode is turned off, as it can sometimes affect call audio on some phones. Check in **Definicoes** > **Focus** (iPhone) or **Definicoes** > **Sound** (Android).
