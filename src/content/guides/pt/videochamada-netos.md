## Step 1: Choose an app

The easiest options:
- **FaceTime** (iPhone to iPhone) -- already on your iPhone
- **WhatsApp** -- works on any phone, most people already have it
- **Google Meet** -- works in any web browser, no app needed

## Step 2: Open the app

Tap the app on your home screen. Make sure you're connected to **Wi-Fi** for the best quality.

## Step 3: Find the person you want to call

**FaceTime:** Tap the + button, type their name or number, then tap the video icon.

**WhatsApp:** Open the chat with the person and tap the **video camera icon** at the top right.

## Step 4: Wait for them to answer

Your phone will ring on their end. When they answer, you'll see their face on your screen and they'll see yours. **Smile -- they can see you!**

## Step 5: During the call

Hold your phone at **arm's length** with the front camera facing you. Speak normally -- the microphone picks up your voice clearly. To end the call, tap the red button.
