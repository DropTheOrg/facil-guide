## Passo 1 : The letter keys

The large area in the middle of the keyboard has all the letter keys, arranged in the QWERTY layout. Just press a letter to type it. Letters appear wherever your cursor (the blinking line) is on the screen.

## Passo 2 : The Shift key

The **Shift** key is on the left and right sides of the keyboard, marked with an up arrow. Hold Shift and press a letter to type a **capital letter**. Release Shift to go back to lowercase.

## Passo 3 : The Space bar

The long key at the bottom of the keyboard is the **Space bar**. Press it to add a space between words.

## Passo 4 : Backspace

The **Backspace** key is in the top-right area of the keyboard. Press it to delete the letter to the left of your cursor. If you make a mistake, press Backspace to erase it.

## Passo 5 : Enter

The **Enter** key (also called Return) is on the right side. Press it to start a new line when typing, or to confirm an action (like submitting a search).

## Passo 6 : Important special keys

- **Tab**: Moves to the next field in a form
- **Escape** (Esc): Closes a menu or cancels an action
- **Ctrl** (or Cmd on Mac): Used with other keys for shortcuts. For example, Ctrl+C copies and Ctrl+V pastes
- **Arrow keys**: Move your cursor up, down, left, or right without using the mouse
