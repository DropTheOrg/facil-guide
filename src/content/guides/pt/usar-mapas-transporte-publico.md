faq:
  - question: "Does this show real-time bus and train times?"
    answer: "In most cities, yes. Google Maps and Apple Maps show live departure times for buses, trains, and metros. In smaller towns, they may only show scheduled times."
  - question: "Do I need internet for this?"
    answer: "You need internet to search for routes. Once you have the directions on screen, you can follow them even if you lose signal briefly, but live updates require a connection."

    answer: "Google Maps shows fare estimates in many cities. Apple Maps is adding this feature in more cities too."
  - question: "What if I miss my stop?"
    answer: "The app will recalculate your route and show you how to get back on track. Keep the app open during your journey for live tracking."
