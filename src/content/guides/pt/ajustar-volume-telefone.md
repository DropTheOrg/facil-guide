## Step 1: Use the side buttons

Every phone has **Volume Up** and **Volume Down** buttons on the side. Press **Volume Up** to make it louder. Press **Volume Down** to make it quieter. A volume indicator will appear on screen.

## Step 2: Adjust during a call

If you can't hear someone during a phone call, press the **Volume Up** button while the call is active. The call volume is separate from your regular volume.

## Step 3: Adjust media volume

When playing music or watching a video, press the **Volume buttons** to adjust the media volume. This is separate from your ringtone volume.

## Step 4: Fine-tune in Settings

For more control, go to **Settings** > **Sounds & Haptics** (iPhone) or **Settings** > **Sound** (Android). Here you can set separate volumes for ringtone, notifications, alarms, and media.
