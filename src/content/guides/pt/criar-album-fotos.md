faq:
  - question: "Does creating an album duplicate my photos?"
    answer: "No. Adding a photo to an album does not create a copy. The photo stays in one place but appears in both your main gallery and the album. It does not use extra storage."
  - question: "Can I put the same photo in multiple albums?"
    answer: "Yes. You can add one photo to as many albums as you like."
  - question: "If I delete a photo from an album, is it gone forever?"
    answer: "On iPhone, removing a photo from an album does NOT delete the original. It just removes it from that album. On Android, it depends on the gallery app -- some delete the photo, some just remove it from the album. Be careful."
  - question: "Can I share an album with someone?"
    answer: "Yes. On iPhone, you can create a Shared Album and invite people. On Android with Google Photos, you can share an album link."

## Passo 2: Go to Albums

Give your album a name. For example:

- "Recipes"
- "Garden"

## Passo 4: Add Photos to the Album

After naming the album, the app will show your photos.

Tap each photo you want to add. A blue checkmark will appear on selected photos.

When you have selected all the photos you want, tap **Add** or **Done**.

## Passo 5: Find Your Album Later

To view your album later:

1. Open the Photos app
2. Go to **Albums**
3. Tap the album name

All the photos you added will be there, organized together.

**Tip:** You can add more photos to an existing album at any time. Open the album, tap **Add Photos** (or the **+** icon), and select more photos.

## Conseguiu!

Your photos are now organized into albums. This makes it much easier to find specific photos -- like all your vacation pictures in one place instead of scrolling through hundreds of photos.
