## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone

## Step 1: Open the Recorder App

- **On iPhone:** Open the **Voice Memos** app (dark waveform icon)
- **On Android:** Open the **Recorder** app or **Voice Recorder** (search for it in your apps)

## Step 2: Start Recording

Tap the large **red circle** button to start recording.

Speak clearly into the bottom of your phone (that is where the microphone is). Hold the phone about 15-20 cm from your mouth.

You will see a timer counting up, showing how long you have been recording.

## Step 3: Stop and Save

When you are done, tap the **red square** button (or the stop button) to end the recording.

- **On iPhone:** The recording is saved automatically. Tap it to rename it (for example, "Doctor appointment notes")
- **On Android:** You may be asked to name the recording and tap **Save**

## Step 4: Listen to Your Recording

Find your recording in the list and tap it to play it back.

You can **pause**, **rewind**, and **fast-forward** using the playback controls.

To share it, tap the **Share** button and choose how you want to send it (WhatsApp, email, or message).

## You Did It!

You recorded a voice memo. This is useful for remembering shopping lists, recording lectures, saving ideas, or keeping notes from a doctor visit.
