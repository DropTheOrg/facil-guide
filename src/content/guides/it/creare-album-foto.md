## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- Some photos already on your phone

## Step 1: Open the Photos App

- **On iPhone:** Tap the **Photos** app (colorful flower icon)
- **On Android:** Tap **Google Photos** or your phone's **Gallery** app

## Step 2: Go to Albums

- **On iPhone:** Tap **Albums** at the bottom of the screen
- **On Android (Google Photos):** Tap **Library** at the bottom, then **Albums**

## Step 3: Create a New Album

- **On iPhone:** Tap the **+** button in the top-left, then tap **New Album**
- **On Android:** Tap **Create album** or the **+** button

Give your album a name. For example:
- "Holiday 2025"
- "Grandchildren"
- "Recipes"
- "Garden"

## Step 4: Add Photos to the Album

After naming the album, the app will show your photos.

Tap each photo you want to add. A blue checkmark will appear on selected photos.

When you have selected all the photos you want, tap **Add** or **Done**.

## Step 5: Find Your Album Later

To view your album later:

1. Open the Photos app
2. Go to **Albums**
3. Tap the album name

All the photos you added will be there, organized together.

**Tip:** You can add more photos to an existing album at any time. Open the album, tap **Add Photos** (or the **+** icon), and select more photos.

## You Did It!

Your photos are now organized into albums. This makes it much easier to find specific photos -- like all your vacation pictures in one place instead of scrolling through hundreds of photos.
