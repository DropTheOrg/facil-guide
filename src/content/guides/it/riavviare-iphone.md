## Passo 1: Find the Side button

The **Side button** is on the right side of your iPhone. It's the long button you normally use to lock or wake your screen.

## Passo 2: Press and hold to turn off

Press and hold the **Side button** and either **Volume button** at the same time. After a few seconds, a slider will appear on screen that says **"slide to power off."**

## Passo 3: Slide to power off

Use your finger to **drag the slider** to the right. Your iPhone screen will go dark. Wait about 10 seconds for it to fully shut down.

## Passo 4: Turn it back on

Press and hold the **Side button** again until you see the Apple logo appear. Your iPhone will start up. This takes about 30 seconds. Once you see your Lock Screen, your iPhone is ready to use again.
