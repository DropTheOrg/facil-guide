## Passaggio 1 : Find what you want to capture

Open the screen you want to save as a photo. It can be a message, a photo, a website, or anything else on your screen.

## Passaggio 2 : Press the buttons

Press and hold the **Power button** and the **Volume Down button** at the same time. Hold both buttons for about one second.

## Passaggio 3 : See the confirmation

Your screen will flash briefly, and you may hear a camera shutter sound. A small preview of the screenshot will appear at the bottom of your screen. This means it worked.

## Passaggio 4 : Find your screenshot

Open the **Photos** app (or **Gallery** app on some phones). Look for a folder called **Screenshots**. Your captured image will be there. You can share it, edit it, or delete it from this screen.
