faq:
  - question: "Does a brighter screen use more battery?"
    answer: "Yes. The brighter your screen, the faster your battery drains. Lowering the brightness or using auto-brightness helps save battery."
  - question: "What is auto-brightness?"
    answer: "Auto-brightness lets your phone adjust the screen brightness automatically based on how much light is around you. In a dark room, it dims the screen. Outside in sunlight, it makes it brighter."
  - question: "Why can I not see my screen in the sun?"
    answer: "Even at maximum brightness, direct sunlight can make screens hard to read. Move to a shaded area, cup your hand over the screen, or increase brightness to maximum temporarily."

## Cosa le servira

- Il suo telefono iPhone o Android

## Passo 1: Open Quick Impostazioni

- **Su iPhone:** Swipe down from the **top-right corner** of the screen (or up from the bottom on older models)
- **Su Android:** Swipe down from the **top** of the screen

You will see quick settings icons and a brightness slider.

## Passo 2: Drag the Brightness Slider

Look for the **brightness slider**. It looks like a bar with a sun icon.

- **Drag it to the right** to make the screen brighter
- **Drag it to the left** to make the screen dimmer

Adjust it until the screen is comfortable for your eyes.

## Passo 3: Turn On Auto-Brightness (Optional)

If you want your phone to adjust brightness automatically:

- **Su iPhone:** Go to **Impostazioni** > **Accessibility** > **Display & Text Size** > turn on **Auto-Brightness**
- **Su Android:** Go to **Impostazioni** > **Display** > turn on **Adaptive Brightness**

With this turned on, your phone will get brighter outside and dimmer indoors, automatically.

## Ce l'ha fatta!

You can now adjust your screen brightness whenever you need to. Lower it at night to be easier on your eyes, and raise it outside so you can see clearly.
