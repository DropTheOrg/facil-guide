## Passaggio 1 : Connect to Wi-Fi

Before updating, make sure your phone is connected to Wi-Fi. Updates can be large and may use a lot of mobile data.

## Passaggio 2 : Charge your phone

Make sure your phone has at least 50% battery, or plug it into a charger. The update process can take a while and you do not want your phone to run out of power.

## Passaggio 3 : Open Settings

Open the **Settings** app (the gear icon). Scroll down and look for **System** or **About phone**. Tap on it.

## Passaggio 4 : Check for updates

Look for **Software update** or **System update**. Tap on it, then tap **Check for updates**. Your phone will search for the latest available version.

## Passaggio 5 : Download and install

If an update is available, tap **Download and install**. The download may take several minutes depending on your Internet speed. Once downloaded, your phone will ask you to restart. Tap **Restart now**. Your phone will turn off, install the update, and turn back on. This may take 10 to 20 minutes. Do not turn off your phone during this process.
