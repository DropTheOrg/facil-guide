    answer: "Yes, Spotify has a free version with ads. You can listen to music, but songs will be interrupted by short advertisements every few songs. The paid version (Spotify Premium) removes ads and lets you download music for offline listening."
  - question: "Do I need internet to use Spotify?"
    answer: "The free version requires internet (Wi-Fi or mobile data). With Spotify Premium, you can download songs and listen without internet."
  - question: "Can I use Spotify with a Bluetooth speaker?"
    answer: "Yes. Connect your phone to a Bluetooth speaker first (Settings > Bluetooth), then play music in Spotify. The sound will come through the speaker."
  - question: "How much data does Spotify use?"
    answer: "About 40-70 MB per hour on normal quality. On Wi-Fi, it is free. On mobile data, about 1 hour of music uses the same data as loading 30-50 web pages."
