## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone (already connected to Wi-Fi)
- Your guest's phone

## Step 1: The Easy Way (iPhone to iPhone)

If both of you have iPhones:

1. Make sure **Wi-Fi** and **Bluetooth** are turned on for both phones
2. Make sure you are in each other's **Contacts**
3. Ask your guest to go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi** and tap your network name
4. A pop-up will appear on YOUR phone saying "Share Your Wi-Fi Password?"
5. Tap **Share Password**

Your guest is now connected. No password typing needed.

## Step 2: The QR Code Way (Works for Everyone)

On Android (and some iPhones):

1. Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi** (or **Network**)
2. Tap the network you are connected to
3. Look for **Share** or a **QR code** icon
4. A QR code will appear on your screen

Ask your guest to open their camera and point it at the QR code. Their phone will connect to your Wi-Fi automatically.

## Step 3: Find Your Password Manually

If the other methods do not work, you can look up your password:

- **On iPhone (iOS 16+):** Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi** > Tap the **(i)** next to your network > Tap **Password** > Confirm with Face ID or passcode
- **On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi** > Tap your network > Tap **Share** and the password will be shown below the QR code

Write it down or show it to your guest.

## Step 4: Check Your Router

If you cannot find the password on your phone:

- Look at the **sticker on your router** (the box that gives you internet). It usually shows the Wi-Fi name and password
- The password is often on the bottom or back of the router

## You Did It!

You shared your Wi-Fi password with your guest. No more spelling out long passwords letter by letter.
