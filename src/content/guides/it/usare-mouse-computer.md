## Passaggio 1 : Hold the mouse correctly

Place your hand over the mouse so it rests comfortably in your palm. Your index finger should rest on the **left button**, and your middle finger on the **right button**. Move the mouse on a flat surface to move the arrow (cursor) on the screen.

## Passaggio 2 : Left click

Press the **left button** once with your index finger. This is called a "click." You use it to select things, press buttons, and follow links. This is the action you will use most often.

## Passaggio 3 : Double click

Press the **left button** twice quickly. This is called a "double-click." You use it to open files, folders, and programs. The two clicks need to be fast -- try tapping quickly twice.

## Passaggio 4 : Right click

Press the **right button** once with your middle finger. This opens a small menu with extra options. For example, you can right-click on a file to see options like Copy, Delete, or Rename.

## Passaggio 5 : Scroll

Most mice have a small **wheel** between the two buttons. Roll it up or down with your index finger to scroll through web pages, documents, and lists. This lets you move up and down a page without clicking anything.
