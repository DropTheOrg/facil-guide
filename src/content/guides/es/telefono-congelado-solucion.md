  - question: "Will I lose my photos or messages?"
    answer: "No. A force restart does not delete anything on your phone. It is like turning it off and on again."
  - question: "Why does my phone freeze?"
    answer: "Phones can freeze when an app crashes, when memory is full, or when the software has a temporary problem. It happens to everyone."
  - question: "What if it keeps freezing often?"
    answer: "If your phone freezes regularly, try updating your software, deleting apps you do not use, or freeing up storage space. If the problem continues, visit a phone repair shop."

## Paso 1 : Do not panic

A frozen phone is very common and almost always fixable. Your photos, messages, and data are safe. You just need to restart the phone.

## Paso 2 : Try waiting 30 seconds

Sometimes the phone just needs a moment to finish what it is doing. Wait about 30 seconds and see if the screen starts responding again.

## Paso 3 : Force restart your phone

If waiting did not help, you need to force restart. The method depends on your phone:

**iPhone (with Face ID or iPhone 8 and newer):**
1. Press and quickly release the **Volume Up** button
2. Press and quickly release the **Volume Down** button
3. Press and hold the **Side button** until you see the Apple logo

**iPhone (with Home button, iPhone 7):**
Press and hold the **Volume Down** button and the **Side button** together until the Apple logo appears.

**Android phones:**
Press and hold the **Power button** for 10 to 20 seconds until the phone restarts. On some phones, hold **Power + Volume Down** together.

## Paso 4 : Wait for the restart

Your phone will show its logo (Apple or your phone brand) and restart. This takes about one to two minutes. Once it is back on, everything should work normally again.
