faq:
  - question: "Does using the flashlight drain my battery?"
    answer: "Yes, but slowly. Using the flashlight for a few minutes is fine. If you leave it on for a long time (more than 30 minutes), it will use noticeable battery. Turn it off when you no longer need it."
  - question: "Can I change how bright the flashlight is?"
    answer: "On iPhone, yes. Press and hold the flashlight icon in Control Center to see brightness options. On most Android phones, the flashlight has one brightness level, but some Samsung and Pixel phones let you adjust it."
  - question: "Why is my flashlight not working?"
    answer: "If the flashlight does not turn on, your battery might be very low (below 5%). Some phones also disable the flashlight while the camera is open. Close the camera app and try again."
  - question: "Will the flashlight turn off by itself?"
    answer: "No. The flashlight stays on until you turn it off manually. If your phone runs out of battery, the flashlight will turn off."

## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android

## Paso 1: Open the Quick Ajustes

You do not need to unlock your phone fully to use the flashlight.

- **On iPhone (with Face ID):** Swipe down from the **top-right corner** of the screen
- **On iPhone (with Home button):** Swipe **up** from the bottom of the screen
- **En Android:** Swipe **down** from the top of the screen with two fingers

This opens the Control Center (iPhone) or Quick Ajustes panel (Android).

## Paso 2: Tap the Flashlight Icon

Look for the flashlight icon. It looks like a small torch or flashlight.

- **En iPhone:** Tap the **flashlight icon** (bottom-left area of Control Center)
- **En Android:** Look for the **Flashlight** or **Torch** tile in Quick Ajustes and tap it

The flashlight on the back of your phone will turn on immediately.

## Paso 3: Turn It Off When Done

To turn off the flashlight, repeat the same steps:

1. Open Quick Ajustes or Control Center again
2. Tap the flashlight icon again

The icon will no longer be highlighted, and the light will turn off.

**Tip:** On iPhone, you can also ask **Siri**: say "Hey Siri, turn on my flashlight." Say the same command to turn it off.

## Lo ha conseguido!

You now know how to use your phone as a flashlight. It works even in the dark, and you can turn it on without unlocking your phone.
