Open a conversation. **Press and hold** the specific message you want to delete. A menu will appear. Tap **Delete** or the trash icon. Confirm by tapping **Delete** again.

## Step 3: Delete an entire conversation

Go back to the main Messages list. **Swipe left** on the conversation you want to delete (iPhone) or **press and hold** the conversation (Android). Tap **Delete**. The entire conversation will be removed.
