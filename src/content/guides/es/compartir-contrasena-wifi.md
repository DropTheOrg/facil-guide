faq:
  - question: "Can I share Wi-Fi from iPhone to Android?"
    answer: "The automatic sharing feature only works between Apple devices. For Android guests, you will need to tell them the password or use the QR code method described in this guide."
  - question: "Is it safe to share my Wi-Fi password?"
    answer: "Yes, sharing with people you trust is safe. They can only use your internet, not see your files or personal information. If you are worried, you can change your Wi-Fi password later."
  - question: "What if the automatic share pop-up does not appear?"
    answer: "Make sure both phones have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on. Both people should be in each other's Contacts. Keep the phones close together (within 1 meter)."

## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android (already connected to Wi-Fi)
- Your guest's phone

## Paso 1: The Easy Way (iPhone to iPhone)

If both of you have iPhones:

1. Make sure **Wi-Fi** and **Bluetooth** are turned on for both phones
2. Make sure you are in each other's **Contacts**
3. Ask your guest to go to **Ajustes** > **Wi-Fi** and tap your network name
4. A pop-up will appear on YOUR phone saying "Share Your Wi-Fi Password?"
5. Tap **Share Password**

Your guest is now connected. No password typing needed.

## Paso 2: The QR Code Way (Works for Everyone)

On Android (and some iPhones):

1. Go to **Ajustes** > **Wi-Fi** (or **Network**)
2. Tap the network you are connected to
3. Look for **Share** or a **QR code** icon
4. A QR code will appear on your screen

Ask your guest to open their camera and point it at the QR code. Their phone will connect to your Wi-Fi automatically.

## Paso 3: Find Your Password Manually

If the other methods do not work, you can look up your password:

- **On iPhone (iOS 16+):** Go to **Ajustes** > **Wi-Fi** > Tap the **(i)** next to your network > Tap **Password** > Confirm with Face ID or passcode
- **En Android:** Go to **Ajustes** > **Wi-Fi** > Tap your network > Tap **Share** and the password will be shown below the QR code

Write it down or show it to your guest.

## Paso 4: Check Your Router

If you cannot find the password on your phone:

- Look at the **sticker on your router** (the box that gives you internet). It usually shows the Wi-Fi name and password
- The password is often on the bottom or back of the router

## Lo ha conseguido!

You shared your Wi-Fi password with your guest. No more spelling out long passwords letter by letter.
