## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android
- A wireless printer connected to your Wi-Fi network
- Paper and ink in the printer

## Paso 1: Make Sure Your Printer Is On and Connected

Turn on your printer and make sure it is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your phone.

Most wireless printers have a small screen or light that shows the Wi-Fi connection status. If the Wi-Fi light is solid (not blinking), the printer is connected.

## Paso 2: Open What You Want to Print

On your phone, open the document, photo, email, or web page you want to print.

## Paso 3: Find the Print Option

- **En iPhone:** Tap the **Share** button (square with an arrow pointing up), then scroll down and tap **Print**
- **En Android:** Tap the **three dots** menu (top-right corner), then tap **Print** or **Share** > **Print**

If you are in the Photos app, look for the Share button and then Print.

## Paso 4: Seleccione Your Printer

A print preview screen will appear. Tap **Seleccione Printer** or **Printer** and choose your printer from the list.

You can also choose:
- **Number of copies** (usually 1)
- **Color or black and white**
- **Paper size** (usually A4 or Letter)

## Paso 5: Tap Print

When everything looks right, tap the **Print** button. Your printer will start printing.

Wait a moment. The document or photo will come out of the printer.

## Lo ha conseguido!

You printed something directly from your phone. No computer needed. This works for photos, emails, recipes, boarding passes, and more.
