## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- Google Maps or Apple Maps (both are free)
- An internet connection

## Step 1: Open the Maps App

- **On iPhone:** Open **Apple Maps** (or **Google Maps** if you have it installed)
- **On Android:** Open **Google Maps** (pre-installed on most phones)

## Step 2: Enter Your Destination

Tap the **search box** at the top and type where you want to go. For example:

Tap the correct result from the suggestions.

## Step 3: Select Public Transport

After entering your destination, you will see options at the top of the screen:

Tap the **train or bus icon** to see public transport options.

## Step 4: Choose a Route

The app will show you several route options. For each route, you will see:

- **Total travel time**
- **Which buses, trains, or metros to take**

- **Walking distance** to and from stops
- **Departure times** (often live)

Tap the route that works best for you.

## Step 5: Follow the Directions

The app will guide you step by step:

1. Walk to the bus stop or station
2. Board the correct bus or train (the app shows the line number and direction)
