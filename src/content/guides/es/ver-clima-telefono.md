## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android

## Paso 1: Open the Weather App

- **En iPhone:** Find the **Weather** app (blue icon with a sun and clouds). Tap it.
- **En Android:** Find the **Weather** app or **Google Weather** widget on your home screen. If you do not see it, search for "Weather" in your apps.

## Paso 2: Allow Location Access

The first time you open the app, it may ask for permission to use your location. Tap **Allow** or **While Using the App**.

This lets the app show the weather for where you are right now.

## Paso 3: Read the Forecast

The weather app shows you:

- **Current temperature** -- how warm or cold it is right now
- **High and low** -- the warmest and coldest it will be today
- **Conditions** -- sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy
- **Hourly forecast** -- what the weather will be like hour by hour
- **Weekly forecast** -- the next 7-10 days

Scroll down to see more details like wind speed, humidity, and UV index.

## Paso 4: Add Another City

To check the weather somewhere else:

- **En iPhone:** Tap the **list icon** (three horizontal lines) at the bottom, then tap the **+** button. Type a city name and add it.
- **En Android:** Tap the **+** icon or search icon, type a city name, and add it.

You can switch between cities by swiping left or right.

## Lo ha conseguido!

You can now check the weather anytime. Check it in the morning to decide what to wear, or before a trip to know what to pack.
