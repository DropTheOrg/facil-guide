- **Recent**: Tap the Recents tab to see people you called or who called you recently
- **Keypad**: Tap the Keypad tab to type a phone number directly

## Paso 3 : Find the person you want to call

If using **Contacts**, scroll through the list or use the search bar at the top to type the person's name. If using the **Keypad**, type the full phone number.

## Paso 4 : Start the call

Tap the person's name in your contacts, or tap the **green phone icon** after typing a number on the keypad. The call will begin.
