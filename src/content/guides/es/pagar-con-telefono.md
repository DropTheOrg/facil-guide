## What You Will Need

- An iPhone (iPhone SE or newer) or Android phone with NFC
- A debit or credit card from a supported bank
- Face ID, Touch ID, or a screen lock set up on your phone

## Step 1: Open the Wallet App

- **On iPhone:** Open the **Wallet** app (it looks like a wallet with cards inside)
- **On Android:** Open **Google Wallet** (or **Google Pay**). Download it from the Play Store if you do not have it.

## Step 2: Add Your Card

Tap the **+** button to add a new card.

- **On iPhone:** Tap **Debit or Credit Card** > **Continue**. Hold your card in front of the camera to scan it, or type the card number manually.
- **On Android:** Tap **Add to Wallet** > **Payment card**. Scan the card with your camera or type the details.

Your bank may send you a verification code by SMS or ask you to open your banking app to approve.

## Step 3: Verify Your Card

After adding the card, your bank needs to verify it is really yours.

- They may send a **code by SMS** -- enter it in the Wallet app
- Or they may ask you to **open your banking app** and approve there

Once verified, your card is ready to use.

## Step 4: Pay at a Store

When you are at a checkout:

1. **Look for the contactless symbol** on the payment terminal (four curved lines, like a Wi-Fi symbol turned sideways)
2. **Unlock your payment:**
   - **On iPhone:** Double-press the **side button** and confirm with **Face ID** or **Touch ID**
   - **On Android:** Unlock your phone normally. Google Pay activates automatically when you hold your phone near the terminal.
3. **Hold the back of your phone** near the payment terminal (within 2-3 centimeters)
4. Wait for a **beep** or **vibration** and a checkmark on your screen

The payment is done.

## Step 5: Check Your Receipt

After paying:

- A notification will appear on your phone showing the amount charged
- You can see all your payments in the Wallet app under your card

## You Did It!

You can now pay at any store that accepts contactless payments. It is faster than fumbling for your wallet, and safer than handing over your card.
