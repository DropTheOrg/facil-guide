## Step 1: Open Settings

Tap the **Settings** app on your home screen. It looks like a grey gear icon.

## Step 2: Find Display settings

**On iPhone:** Tap **Display & Brightness**, then tap **Text Size**.

**On Android:** Tap **Display**, then tap **Font size** or **Display size** (the name varies by phone brand).

## Step 3: Drag the slider

You'll see a slider at the bottom of the screen. **Drag it to the right** to make text bigger. You'll see a preview of the text size change as you drag.

## Step 4: Check if it's comfortable

Open a few apps like Messages or your web browser to see how the new text size looks. If it's still too small, go back and drag the slider further to the right.
