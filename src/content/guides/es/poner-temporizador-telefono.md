faq:
  - question: "Can I set more than one timer at the same time?"
    answer: "On iPhone (iOS 17 and later), yes. You can run multiple timers at once. On older iPhones or most Android phones, you can usually only run one timer at a time, but you can set multiple alarms instead."
  - question: "Will the timer sound if my phone is on silent?"
    answer: "On iPhone, the timer will vibrate but not make a sound if your phone is on silent mode. If you want to hear the alarm, switch off silent mode using the switch on the side of your phone. On Android, timers usually sound even in silent mode."
  - question: "Can I use the timer without unlocking my phone?"
    answer: "Yes. You can ask Siri (iPhone) or Google Assistant (Android) to set a timer without touching your phone. Just say 'Set a timer for 10 minutes.'"

## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android

## Paso 1: Open the Clock App

Find the **Clock** app on your phone and tap it.

- **En iPhone:** It looks like a white clock face on a black background
- **En Android:** It is usually called **Clock** with a round clock icon

## Paso 2: Go to the Timer Tab

At the bottom of the Clock app, you will see several tabs: Alarm, Clock, Timer, Stopwatch.

Tap **Timer**.

## Paso 3: Set the Time

Use the scroll wheels or number pad to set how long you want the timer to run.

For example:
- Boiling an egg: set **10 minutes**
- Baking a cake: set **30 minutes**
- A quick nap: set **20 minutes**

You can set hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Paso 4: Tap Start

Tap the **Start** button. The countdown will begin.

You can now close the app or use your phone for other things. The timer runs in the background.

When the time is up, your phone will ring or vibrate to let you know.

To **cancel** the timer before it finishes, open the Clock app, go to Timer, and tap **Cancelar** or **Stop**.

## Lo ha conseguido!

You set a timer on your phone. This is useful for cooking, exercise, parking meters, laundry, and anything else where you need a reminder after a set amount of time.
