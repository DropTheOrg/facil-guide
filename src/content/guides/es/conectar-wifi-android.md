faq:
  - question: "What is Wi-Fi?"
    answer: "Wi-Fi is a wireless way to connect to the Internet. When you connect to Wi-Fi, you do not use your mobile data."
  - question: "Why does it ask for a password?"
    answer: "Most Wi-Fi networks are protected with a password to keep them private. You usually find the password on the back of your router or from the network owner."
  - question: "Why is Wi-Fi not connecting?"
    answer: "Make sure you typed the password correctly. Passwords are case-sensitive. If it still does not work, try turning Wi-Fi off and on again, or restart your phone."

## Paso 1 : Open Settings

Find the **Settings** app on your phone. It looks like a small gear icon. Tap it to open.

## Paso 2 : Tap Network and Internet

In the Settings menu, look for **Network & Internet** or **Connections** (the name varies by phone). Tap on it.

## Paso 3 : Tap Wi-Fi

Tap on **Wi-Fi**. Make sure the Wi-Fi switch at the top is turned **on** (it should be blue or green).

## Paso 4 : Choose your network

A list of available Wi-Fi networks will appear. Look for the name of the network you want to connect to (for example, your home network name). Tap on it.

## Paso 5 : Enter the password

If the network requires a password, a box will appear asking you to type it. Enter the password carefully -- it is case-sensitive (capital and lowercase letters matter). Then tap **Connect**. After a few seconds, you should see "Connected" under the network name.
