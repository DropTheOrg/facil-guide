## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone

## Step 1: Open Quick Settings

- **On iPhone:** Swipe down from the **top-right corner** of the screen
- **On Android:** Swipe down from the **top** of the screen with two fingers

## Step 2: Tap Do Not Disturb

- **On iPhone:** Tap **Focus**, then tap **Do Not Disturb** (crescent moon icon)
- **On Android:** Look for the **Do Not Disturb** tile (circle with a line through it) and tap it

The icon will light up, meaning Do Not Disturb is now active.

Your phone will stop ringing, vibrating, and showing notification banners.

## Step 3: Set a Schedule (Optional)

If you want Do Not Disturb to turn on and off automatically:

- **On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Focus** > **Do Not Disturb** > **Add Schedule**. Set it to turn on at bedtime and off in the morning.
- **On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Sound** > **Do Not Disturb** > **Schedules**. Set your sleep hours.

For example, set it from 10 PM to 7 AM every night.

## Step 4: Turn It Off

When you are ready to receive notifications again:

1. Open Quick Settings (same swipe as Step 1)
2. Tap the Do Not Disturb icon again to turn it off

The icon will no longer be highlighted, and notifications will resume.

## You Did It!

You can now silence your phone whenever you need peace and quiet. Use it at night, during meals, in meetings, or anytime you want to focus without interruptions.
