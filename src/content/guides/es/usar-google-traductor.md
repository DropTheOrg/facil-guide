## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android
- The Google Translate app (free from App Store or Google Play)
- An internet connection (or downloaded languages for offline use)

## Paso 1: Download Google Translate

If you do not have it yet:

- **En iPhone:** Open the **App Store**, search for **Google Translate**, and tap **Get**
- **En Android:** It may already be installed. If not, open the **Play Store**, search for **Google Translate**, and tap **Install**

## Paso 2: Open the App and Elija Languages

Open **Google Translate**. At the top, you will see two languages:

- **Left:** The language you are translating FROM
- **Right:** The language you are translating TO

Tap either language to change it. For example, set the left to **English** and the right to **Spanish**.

## Paso 3: Type or Paste Your Text

Tap the text box that says **Enter text** and type the word or sentence you want to translate.

The translation will appear below instantly as you type.

**Tip:** You can also copy text from a website or message, then paste it here.

## Paso 4: Use the Camera to Translate Signs or Menus

This is especially useful when traveling:

1. Tap the **Camera** icon below the text box
2. Point your phone at the text you want to translate (a menu, a sign, a label)
3. The translated text will appear on your screen, right over the original

You can also take a photo first and then select the text to translate.

## Paso 5: Use Voice Translation

To translate something you hear or want to say:

1. Tap the **Microphone** icon
2. Speak clearly in the source language
3. The app will show the translation and can even read it aloud

This is useful for asking directions or ordering food in another language.

## Lo ha conseguido!
