## Lo que va a necesitar

- Su telefono iPhone o Android

## Paso 1: Open the Recorder App

- **En iPhone:** Open the **Voice Memos** app (dark waveform icon)
- **En Android:** Open the **Recorder** app or **Voice Recorder** (search for it in your apps)

## Paso 2: Start Recording

Tap the large **red circle** button to start recording.

Speak clearly into the bottom of your phone (that is where the microphone is). Hold the phone about 15-20 cm from your mouth.

You will see a timer counting up, showing how long you have been recording.

## Paso 3: Stop and Save

When you are done, tap the **red square** button (or the stop button) to end the recording.

- **En iPhone:** The recording is saved automatically. Tap it to rename it (for example, "Doctor appointment notes")
- **En Android:** You may be asked to name the recording and tap **Save**

## Paso 4: Listen to Your Recording

Find your recording in the list and tap it to play it back.

You can **pause**, **rewind**, and **fast-forward** using the playback controls.

To share it, tap the **Share** button and choose how you want to send it (WhatsApp, email, or message).

## Lo ha conseguido!

You recorded a voice memo. This is useful for remembering shopping lists, recording lectures, saving ideas, or keeping notes from a doctor visit.
