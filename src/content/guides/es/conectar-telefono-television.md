faq:
  - question: "Do I need a smart TV for this?"
    answer: "Screen mirroring works best with a smart TV. If your TV is not a smart TV, you can buy a streaming device like Apple TV, Chromecast, or Amazon Fire TV Stick and plug it into your TV."
  - question: "Do my phone and TV need to be on the same Wi-Fi?"
    answer: "Yes. Your phone and your TV (or streaming device) must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for screen mirroring to work."
  - question: "Why is there a delay between my phone and the TV?"
    answer: "A small delay is normal. Screen mirroring sends the image over Wi-Fi, which takes a fraction of a second. If the delay is very long, move closer to your Wi-Fi router or restart both devices."
  - question: "Can I use my phone while it is mirroring?"
    answer: "Yes, but everything you do on your phone will show on the TV. If you open a private message, the people watching the TV will see it too."
  - question: "Does screen mirroring use a lot of battery?"
    answer: "Yes, more than normal use. If you plan to mirror for a long time, keep your phone plugged in to a charger."
