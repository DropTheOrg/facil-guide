## What you will learn

You will learn how to open and set up the Health app on your iPhone, view your daily steps, add health information like medications and allergies, and share your data with a family member or doctor.

## What you need

- An iPhone running iOS 15 or later
- The Health app (it comes pre-installed on every iPhone)

### Step 1: Open the Health app

Find the **Health** app on your home screen. It has a white icon with a red heart. Tap it to open. If this is your first time, the app will ask you to enter basic information like your date of birth, height, and weight. This helps the app give you accurate health insights.

### Step 2: View your daily summary

The first screen you see is the **Summary** tab. It shows your most important health data for today, including steps walked, distance covered, and any other data you track. Scroll down to see more details.

### Step 3: Check your step count

On the Summary screen, tap **Steps** to see a detailed view. You will see how many steps you have taken today, plus a graph showing your steps over the past week, month, or year. Your iPhone tracks this automatically whenever you carry it with you.

### Step 4: Browse all your health categories

Tap the **Browse** tab at the bottom of the screen. This shows all health categories organized by topic: **Activity**, **Body Measurements**, **Heart**, **Medications**, **Respiratory**, **Sleep**, and more. Tap any category to see the data your iPhone has collected.

### Step 5: Add a medication

Tap the **Browse** tab, then tap **Medications**. Tap **Add a Medication**. Type the name of your medication and select it from the list. Choose the strength and how often you take it. The app can send you reminders at the times you choose so you do not forget.

### Step 6: Set up your Medical ID

Tap your **profile picture** in the top-right corner of the Summary screen, then tap **Medical ID**. Tap **Edit** and fill in important information like your **blood type**, **allergies**, **medical conditions**, and **emergency contacts**. Turn on **Show When Locked** so first responders can see this information even if your phone is locked.

### Step 7: Share your health data with someone

Tap the **Sharing** tab at the bottom of the screen. Tap **Share with Someone** and choose a person from your contacts. Select which health data you want to share, such as steps, heart rate, or medications. The person you share with will see your data in their Health app.

## Tips

- Carry your iPhone with you throughout the day to get accurate step counts
- Set medication reminders to help you take pills on time
- Keep your Medical ID updated, especially allergies and emergency contacts
- Review your health trends weekly by tapping on any data category and switching to the week or month view
- If you also have an Apple Watch, it will send additional data like heart rate to the Health app automatically
