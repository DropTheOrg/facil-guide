## What you will learn

You will learn how to install Netflix on your phone, create an account, and start watching movies and TV shows. You will also learn how to search for content and download shows to watch offline (without internet).

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- A Wi-Fi connection (recommended) or mobile data
- A payment method (credit card, debit card, or PayPal)

### Step 1: Download the Netflix app

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). Tap the search bar at the top and type **Netflix**. Find the app with the red "N" logo and tap **Get** or **Install**. Wait for the download to finish.

### Step 2: Open the app and create an account

Tap **Open** to launch Netflix. If you do not have an account yet, tap **Sign Up** or visit [netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com) in your web browser. Follow the steps to choose a plan and enter your payment information. Netflix offers a few plans at different prices -- the basic plan is enough to get started.

### Step 3: Sign in to your account

On the Netflix app, tap **Sign In**. Enter the **email address** and **password** you used when creating your account. Tap **Sign In** again.

### Step 4: Choose your profile

Netflix lets each family member have their own profile. Tap your name to select your profile. If you want to create a new profile, tap **Add Profile** and enter a name.

### Step 5: Browse and search for something to watch

The home screen shows recommended movies and shows. Scroll up and down to browse. To find something specific, tap the **magnifying glass icon** at the top and type the name of a movie, show, or actor.

### Step 6: Start watching

Tap on any movie or show to see its description. Tap the **Play** button to start watching. You can pause at any time by tapping the screen and then tapping the **pause icon**. To go back, tap the **arrow** in the top-left corner.

### Step 7: Download a show to watch offline

Find a movie or show you want to save for later. Tap the **download icon** (an arrow pointing down) next to the title. The show will download to your phone. To find your downloads later, tap **My Netflix** at the bottom, then tap **Downloads**.

## Tips

- Use Wi-Fi when streaming to avoid using your mobile data
- If you share your account with family, each person should have their own profile so recommendations stay personal
- To adjust subtitle size, go to your account settings at [netflix.com/account](https://www.netflix.com/account) and look for **Subtitle Appearance**
- If the app is not working, try closing it completely and reopening it
