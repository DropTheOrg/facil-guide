## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to make the text on your iPhone bigger. If you find it hard to read small text on your phone, you can easily increase the size in just a few taps. This works across most apps including Messages, Mail, and Safari.

## What you need

- An iPhone

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Settings

On your home screen, tap the **Settings** icon. It looks like grey gears.

### Step 2: Tap Display and Brightness

Scroll down a little and tap **"Display & Brightness"**.

### Step 3: Tap Text Size

Tap **"Text Size"**. A slider will appear on the screen.

### Step 4: Drag the slider to the right

You will see a slider with a small "A" on the left and a large "A" on the right. **Drag the slider to the right** to make text bigger. The sample text above the slider will change so you can preview the size.

### Step 5: Check the result

Press the back arrow or go to the home screen. Open an app like **Messages** or **Safari** to see the new text size. If you want it bigger or smaller, go back to Settings and adjust the slider.

## Helpful tips

- **Bold text**: For even easier reading, go to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** and turn on **"Bold Text"**. This makes all text thicker and easier to see.
- **Zoom**: If you need to temporarily enlarge something on screen, double-tap with three fingers to zoom in. Double-tap with three fingers again to zoom back out. Enable this in **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Zoom**.
- **Per-app settings**: Some apps like Safari have their own text size controls. In Safari, tap the **"AA"** button in the address bar to change text size for the website you are viewing.
