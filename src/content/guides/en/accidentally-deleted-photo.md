  - question: "How long do deleted photos stay in the Recently Deleted folder?"
    answer: "On most phones, deleted photos stay in the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days. After that, they are permanently removed and much harder to get back."
  - question: "Can I recover a photo that was deleted more than 30 days ago?"
    answer: "It is very difficult. If you had a cloud backup turned on (like iCloud or Google Photos), the photo might still be there. Otherwise, you would need a professional data recovery service, which can be expensive."
  - question: "Will recovering a photo use more storage space?"
    answer: "Yes. When you recover a photo, it moves back to your main photo library and takes up the same amount of space it did before you deleted it."
  - question: "Does this work for videos too?"
    answer: "Yes. Deleted videos also go to the Recently Deleted folder and can be recovered the same way as photos."
  - question: "How can I avoid accidentally deleting photos in the future?"
    answer: "Turn on cloud backup so your photos are saved online. On iPhone, enable iCloud Photos in Settings. On Android, open Google Photos and turn on Backup. This way, even if you delete a photo, a copy exists in the cloud."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to find and recover a photo that you accidentally deleted from your phone. Most phones keep deleted photos for 30 days before removing them permanently, so there is a good chance you can get your photo back.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- The photo must have been deleted less than 30 days ago

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Photos app

Find the **Photos** app on your phone and tap it to open it. On iPhone, it has a colorful flower icon. On Android, it may be called **Google Photos** or **Gallery** depending on your phone.

### Step 2: Find the Recently Deleted folder on iPhone

If you have an iPhone, tap **Albums** at the bottom of the screen. Scroll down until you see a section called **Utilities**. Tap **Recently Deleted**. You may need to unlock this folder with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.

### Step 3: Find the Trash folder on Android

If you have an Android phone, open **Google Photos** and tap **Library** at the bottom. Then tap **Trash**. If you use a Samsung phone, open **Gallery**, tap the **three-line menu** at the bottom, and tap **Recycle bin**.

### Step 4: Look for your photo

Scroll through the deleted photos to find the one you want to recover. Each photo shows how many days are left before it is permanently deleted.

### Step 5: Recover the photo

Tap the photo you want to recover. Then tap **Recover** (on iPhone) or **Restore** (on Android). The photo will move back to your main photo library, exactly where it was before.

### Step 6: Check your photo library

Go back to your main photo library and confirm the photo is there. It should appear in the same album or location where it was originally saved.

## Tips

- Get into the habit of checking the Recently Deleted folder before panicking about a lost photo.
- Turn on cloud backup (iCloud Photos or Google Photos backup) so your photos are always saved in a second place.
- If you want to permanently delete a photo so nobody can recover it, go to Recently Deleted, select the photo, and tap **Delete** again.
