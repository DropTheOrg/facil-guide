faq:
  - question: "Will blocking unknown callers block important calls?"
    answer: "It might. If a doctor, delivery driver, or other service calls you from an unknown number, the call will go to voicemail. They can still leave a message, and you can call them back."
  - question: "What happens to blocked calls?"
    answer: "Blocked calls are sent straight to voicemail. The caller can leave a message, but your phone will not ring. You will not see a missed call notification."
  - question: "Can I unblock a number later?"
    answer: "Yes. On iPhone, go to Settings, then Phone, then Blocked Contacts to see your blocked list. On Android, open the Phone app, go to Settings, then Blocked numbers. You can remove any number from the list."
  - question: "Do I need an app to block spam calls?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Both iPhone and Android have built-in tools to block unknown callers and report spam. However, apps like Truecaller can identify callers by name, which the built-in tools do not do."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to stop unwanted calls from reaching your phone. You will turn on built-in features that block unknown numbers and spam callers, so your phone only rings when someone you know is calling.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- About 3 minutes

## The steps

### Step 1: Turn on Silence Unknown Callers on iPhone

On iPhone, open **Settings** and tap **Phone**. Scroll down and tap **Silence Unknown Callers**. Turn the switch on. From now on, any call from a number not in your contacts will be sent silently to voicemail.

### Step 2: Turn on spam call filtering on Android

On Android, open the **Phone** app (the one you use to make calls). Tap the **three dots** in the top right corner and choose **Settings**. Look for **Caller ID and spam** or **Spam protection** and turn it on. This tells your phone to warn you when a suspected spam call is coming in.

### Step 3: Block a specific number you have already received a call from

Open your **Phone** app and go to **Recents** (your recent calls list). Find the number you want to block. On iPhone, tap the **i** icon next to the number, scroll down, and tap **Block this Caller**. On Android, tap and hold the number, then tap **Block** or **Block number**.

### Step 4: Report spam calls

When you receive a spam call, reporting it helps your phone and your carrier improve their spam filters. On Android, after a suspected spam call, you may see a prompt to **Report as spam** -- tap it. On iPhone, there is no built-in reporting, but your carrier may have a service (for example, forwarding spam texts to 7726).

### Step 5: Register with your national Do Not Call list

Many countries have official Do Not Call registries that reduce telemarketing calls. In the United States, visit [donotcall.gov](https://www.donotcall.gov) and add your number. In the United Kingdom, register at [tpsonline.org.uk](https://www.tpsonline.org.uk). In the European Union, check your country's data protection authority website.

### Step 6: Check your blocked contacts list

To review who you have blocked, go to **Settings**, then **Phone**, then **Blocked Contacts** on iPhone. On Android, open the **Phone** app, go to **Settings**, then **Blocked numbers**. Remove any number you blocked by mistake.

## Tips

- Save important numbers like your doctor, pharmacy, and bank in your contacts so their calls always come through.
- If you are expecting a call from an unknown number (like a delivery), temporarily turn off Silence Unknown Callers until the call arrives.
- Be careful with apps that promise to block all spam -- some of them collect your data. Stick to well-known apps like Truecaller if you want extra protection.
