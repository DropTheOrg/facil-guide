## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to send an email using Gmail. Email is a free and easy way to send messages, photos, and documents to anyone in the world.

## What you need

- A computer, phone, or tablet with Internet access
- A Gmail account (a Google account)
- The email address of the person you want to write to

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Gmail

Open your web browser and go to **[gmail.com](https://mail.google.com)**. If you are not already signed in, enter your email address and password, then click **"Next"**.

### Step 2: Click Compose

In the top left corner of the screen, click the **"Compose"** button. It has a small pencil icon. A new email window will appear at the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 3: Enter the recipient's email address

In the **"To"** field at the top of the new email window, type the email address of the person you want to send the email to. Make sure to type it exactly right, with no spaces.

### Step 4: Write a subject

Click on the **"Subject"** field and type a short title for your email. This helps the recipient know what your message is about. For example: "Hello from Maria" or "Photos from Sunday".

### Step 5: Write your message

Click in the large white area below the subject line. This is where you type your message. Write whatever you want to say, just like writing a letter.

### Step 6: Send the email

When your message is ready, click the blue **"Send"** button at the bottom left of the compose window. Your email will be sent immediately. You will find a copy in your **"Sent"** folder.

## Helpful tips

- **Attach a file**: To send a photo or document, click the **paperclip icon** at the bottom of the compose window and select the file from your computer.
- **Save as draft**: If you are not ready to send yet, just close the compose window. Gmail automatically saves your email as a draft. You can find it in the **"Drafts"** folder.
- **Check your spelling**: Read your email once before sending. You cannot unsend an email after a few seconds have passed.
