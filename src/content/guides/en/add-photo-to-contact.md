## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- A photo of the person saved on your phone (or you can take one)

## Step 1: Open the Contacts App

Tap the **Contacts** app (or **Phone** app, then tap **Contacts**).

Find the person you want to add a photo to and tap their name.

## Step 2: Tap Edit

- **On iPhone:** Tap **Edit** in the top-right corner
- **On Android:** Tap the **pencil icon** (edit) at the top

## Step 3: Tap the Photo Circle

At the top of the contact page, you will see a circle with the person's initials or a silhouette.

- **On iPhone:** Tap **Add Photo** or the circle itself
- **On Android:** Tap the **camera icon** on the circle

## Step 4: Choose a Photo

You will see options:

- **Choose from gallery:** Pick a photo you already have on your phone
- **Take a photo:** Use your camera to take a new photo right now

Select the photo you want. You can then **crop** it to fit the circle. Move and resize the image so the person's face is centered.

Tap **Choose** or **Done** when it looks right.

## Step 5: Save the Contact

- **On iPhone:** Tap **Done** in the top-right corner
- **On Android:** Tap the **checkmark** or **Save**

The photo is now saved to that contact.

## You Did It!

Now when this person calls you, their photo will appear on your screen. It makes it easier to see who is calling at a glance.
