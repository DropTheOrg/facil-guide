## Step 1: Check what is using your storage

**iPhone:** Go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **iPhone Storage**. You will see a bar chart showing what takes up the most space.

**Android:** Go to **Settings**, then **Storage**. You will see a breakdown of how your space is used.

## Step 2: Delete old photos and videos

Photos and especially videos are the biggest space users. Open your **Photos** app and look for videos you no longer need. Tap on a video, then tap the **trash** icon to delete it. After deleting, empty the **Recently Deleted** folder too (on iPhone: Photos, then Recently Deleted, then Delete All).

## Step 3: Remove apps you do not use

Look through your phone for apps you have not opened in months. To delete an app:
- **iPhone**: Press and hold the app icon, tap **Remove App**, then **Delete App**
- **Android**: Press and hold the app icon, then drag to **Uninstall** or tap **Uninstall**

## Step 4: Clear message attachments

Old text messages with photos and videos take up space. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **iPhone Storage**, and look for **Messages**. You can review and delete large attachments.

## Step 5: Restart and check

After cleaning up, restart your phone. Then go back to Settings and check your storage again. You should see more free space. Try to keep at least 2 to 3 GB free for your phone to run smoothly.
