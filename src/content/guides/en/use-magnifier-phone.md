  - question: "Is the magnifier the same as the camera?"
    answer: "No. The magnifier is a separate tool designed for reading small text. It can zoom in much further than the regular camera and has extra features like adjusting brightness, contrast, and applying colour filters to make text easier to read."
  - question: "Does the magnifier save photos?"
    answer: "It can, but it does not save automatically. You can tap the shutter button to freeze the image and examine it closely. On iPhone, you can then save it if you want. The magnifier is mainly meant for live viewing, not taking photos."
  - question: "Can I use the magnifier in the dark?"
    answer: "Yes. The magnifier can turn on your phone's flashlight to illuminate what you are looking at. This is useful for reading in dimly lit restaurants or medicine cabinets."
  - question: "Does this work on all phones?"
    answer: "The built-in magnifier works on iPhones with iOS 10 or newer and Android phones with Android 10 or newer. If your phone does not have a built-in magnifier, you can download a free magnifier app from the App Store or Google Play Store."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use your phone as a magnifying glass. Your phone has a built-in magnifier tool that uses the camera to zoom in on small text and objects. This is very helpful for reading medicine labels, restaurant menus, price tags, or any small print that is hard to see.

## What you need

- An iPhone with iOS 10 or newer, or an Android phone with Android 10 or newer
- No additional apps needed (the magnifier is built into your phone)

## Steps

### Step 1: Open the magnifier on iPhone

On an iPhone, you can open the magnifier in several ways. The easiest is to swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen to open **Control Centre**, then tap the **magnifying glass** icon. If you do not see it, go to **Settings**, then **Control Centre**, and add **Magnifier** to the list. You can also ask Siri: "Open Magnifier."

### Step 2: Open the magnifier on Android

On an Android phone, open **Settings**, then tap **Accessibility**. Look for **Magnification** and turn it on. Once enabled, you can activate it by tapping the accessibility shortcut (a small person icon) that appears at the bottom of your screen, or by triple-tapping the screen with one finger.

### Step 3: Point your phone at what you want to read

Hold your phone about 15 to 25 centimetres away from the text or object you want to magnify. The screen will show a live, zoomed-in view of what the camera sees. Keep your hand steady for a clear image.

### Step 4: Adjust the zoom level

Use the **zoom slider** to make the text bigger or smaller. On iPhone, drag the slider at the bottom of the screen to the right to zoom in more, or to the left to zoom out. On Android, pinch with two fingers to adjust the zoom. Find a zoom level where the text is large enough to read comfortably.

### Step 5: Improve readability with brightness and contrast

If the text is still hard to read, use the built-in adjustments. On iPhone, tap the **settings** icon (a gear or sliders icon) at the bottom to access brightness, contrast, and colour filters. Try increasing **contrast** to make dark text stand out more. On Android, similar options are available in the magnification settings.

### Step 6: Freeze the image for easier reading

If your hands are shaky or the object is hard to hold steady, you can freeze the image. On iPhone, tap the **shutter** button (the large circle at the bottom) to capture a still image. You can then examine it closely, zoom in further, and even save it. Tap the screen to go back to live view when you are done.

## Tips

- Add the magnifier to your iPhone home screen for quick access. Press and hold the home screen, tap **+** at the top, search for **Magnifier**, and add the widget.
- Turn on the flashlight within the magnifier when reading in low light. Look for the flash or torch icon.
- The magnifier is great for reading medicine bottles, nutrition labels, serial numbers, and any small print you encounter daily.
- If you wear reading glasses but forgot them, the magnifier is an excellent temporary replacement.
