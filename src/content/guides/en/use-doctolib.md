## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use Doctolib to find a doctor near you and book a medical appointment online. Doctolib is a popular platform in France and Germany that lets you search for healthcare professionals, see their available time slots, and book an appointment without making a phone call.

## What you need

- A phone, tablet, or computer with internet access
- An email address to create your Doctolib account
- Your health insurance information (optional, but helpful)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Doctolib

On your phone, download the **Doctolib** app from the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). You can also go to the website [doctolib.fr](https://www.doctolib.fr) in your internet browser on a phone or computer.

### Step 2: Create an account

Tap **Sign up** or **Create an account**. Enter your first name, last name, email address, and choose a password. You may also need to enter your date of birth and phone number. Tap **Create my account** to finish. Doctolib will send you a confirmation email. Open your email and tap the link to confirm your account.

### Step 3: Search for a doctor

On the main screen, you will see a search bar. Type the type of doctor you need, for example "general practitioner" or "dentist." In the second field, type your city or postal code. Tap **Search** to see a list of doctors near you.

### Step 4: Choose a doctor

Browse the list of results. Each doctor shows their name, address, available appointment types, and the next available time slot. You can also see patient reviews to help you decide. Tap on a doctor's name to see more details about their practice.

### Step 5: Pick a time slot

On the doctor's page, you will see a calendar with available time slots shown in blue. Tap the date and time that works for you. If no time is available soon, you can tap **Next availability** to find the earliest open slot.

### Step 6: Confirm your appointment

After selecting a time slot, Doctolib will ask you to confirm the appointment details. Check the doctor's name, the date, the time, and the type of consultation (in-person or video call). If everything looks correct, tap **Confirm appointment**.

### Step 7: Check your confirmation

You will receive a confirmation email and a notification in the Doctolib app. The appointment will also appear in the **My appointments** section of your account. You can set a reminder so you do not forget.

## Tips

- Use the filters on the search results page to narrow down by availability, consultation type (in-person or video), or language spoken by the doctor.
- If you need an urgent appointment, look for doctors with same-day availability by checking the box for "Available today."
- Save your health insurance details in your Doctolib profile so you do not have to enter them each time.
- You can book video consultations with many doctors directly through Doctolib, which is convenient if you cannot travel.
