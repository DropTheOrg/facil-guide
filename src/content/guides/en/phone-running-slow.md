faq:
  - question: "Why is my phone so slow?"
    answer: "Phones slow down when they run out of storage space, have too many apps running, or need a software update. Old batteries can also cause slowness because the phone reduces its speed to save power."
  - question: "Will deleting apps make my phone faster?"
    answer: "Yes. Removing apps you do not use frees up storage space and stops those apps from running in the background, which can make your phone noticeably faster."
  - question: "Does restarting my phone really help?"
    answer: "Yes. Restarting clears temporary files and stops apps that are stuck running in the background. It is the simplest fix and works surprisingly often."
  - question: "Should I do a factory reset?"
    answer: "A factory reset erases everything on your phone and makes it like new. It is effective but should be a last resort. Always back up your photos and contacts first. Try the other steps in this guide before resetting."
  - question: "How often should I restart my phone?"
    answer: "Restarting once a week is a good habit. It helps keep your phone running smoothly by clearing temporary files and refreshing the system."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn simple steps to make your slow phone faster without spending any money. These steps work on both iPhone and Android and take about 10 minutes.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- About 10 minutes

## The steps

### Step 1: Restart your phone

The easiest fix is a restart. Hold the **power button** and tap **Restart** (or slide to power off on iPhone, then turn it back on). This clears temporary files and stops apps that may be stuck.

### Step 2: Update your software

Old software can cause slowness. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **Software Update**. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **System**, then **Software update**. If an update is available, tap **Download and Install**. Connect to Wi-Fi first.

### Step 3: Delete apps you do not use

Every app takes up space and some run in the background. Look through your home screen for apps you have not opened in months. On iPhone, press and hold the app icon, then tap **Remove App**, then **Delete App**. On Android, press and hold, then drag to **Uninstall** or tap **Uninstall**.

### Step 4: Clear your browser cache

Your web browser stores old data that piles up over time. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Safari**, then tap **Clear History and Website Data**. On Android, open **Chrome**, tap the **three dots**, then **Settings**, then **Privacy and security**, then **Clear browsing data**.

### Step 5: Free up storage space

A phone needs free space to run smoothly. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **iPhone Storage** to see what is using space. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Storage**. Delete old photos, videos, and downloads you no longer need, or move them to cloud storage.

### Step 6: Turn off animations and visual effects

Reducing visual effects can make an older phone feel faster. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Accessibility**, then **Motion**, and turn on **Reduce Motion**. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Accessibility**, and look for **Remove animations** or similar options.

### Step 7: Check your battery health

A worn-out battery can cause your phone to slow down on purpose to prevent shutdowns. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Battery**, then **Battery Health and Charging**. If the maximum capacity is below 80 percent, a battery replacement could make your phone fast again.

## Tips

- Restart your phone once a week to keep it running smoothly.
- Keep at least 10 percent of your storage free at all times.
- Avoid installing apps you only plan to use once.
- Close browser tabs you are not using -- having dozens open slows things down.
