faq:
  - question: "Is it normal for my battery to drain faster as my phone gets older?"
    answer: "Yes. Phone batteries lose capacity over time. After two or three years, your battery may only hold 80 percent of its original charge. You can check your battery health in Settings."
  - question: "Does closing apps save battery?"
    answer: "Not really. On modern phones, apps in the background use very little power. Constantly closing and reopening apps can actually use more battery than leaving them alone."
  - question: "Does dark mode save battery?"
    answer: "Yes, but only on phones with OLED screens (most newer phones). Dark mode uses less power because the screen turns off black pixels completely."
  - question: "Should I let my battery drain to zero before charging?"
    answer: "No. Modern phone batteries last longer if you keep them between 20 and 80 percent. There is no need to fully drain them."
  - question: "When should I replace my battery?"
    answer: "If your battery health is below 80 percent and your phone dies very quickly, it may be time for a battery replacement. Visit an authorized repair center for a new battery."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn the most common reasons why your phone battery drains quickly and how to change a few simple settings to make it last much longer throughout the day.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- About 5 minutes

## The steps

### Step 1: Check which apps use the most battery

On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then tap **Battery**. You will see a list of apps and how much battery each one used. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Battery**, then **Battery usage**. Look for any app using an unusually large amount.

### Step 2: Lower your screen brightness

The screen is the biggest battery drain on any phone. Swipe down from the top of your screen to open the quick settings panel. Find the **brightness slider** and drag it lower. You can also turn on **Auto-Brightness** so the phone adjusts on its own.

### Step 3: Turn off location services for apps that do not need it

Many apps track your location in the background, which uses a lot of battery. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Privacy and Security**, then **Location Services**. Change apps to **While Using** instead of **Always**. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Location**, then **App permissions** and do the same.

### Step 4: Turn on Low Power Mode

On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Battery**, and turn on **Low Power Mode**. This reduces background activity and makes your battery last longer. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Battery**, and turn on **Battery Saver**. You can also add these to your quick settings panel for easy access.

### Step 5: Turn off unnecessary notifications

Every notification lights up your screen and uses power. Go to **Settings**, then **Notifications**. Look through the list and turn off notifications for apps that are not important to you, like games or shopping apps.

### Step 6: Check your battery health

On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Battery**, then **Battery Health and Charging**. Look at the **Maximum Capacity** number. If it is below 80 percent, your battery is worn out and may need replacing. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Battery**, then **Battery health** (availability varies by phone model).

### Step 7: Restart your phone

Sometimes a simple restart fixes battery drain caused by apps stuck running in the background. Hold the **power button** and tap **Restart**. This gives your phone a fresh start.

## Tips

- Charge your phone before it drops below 20 percent to help preserve battery health over time.
- Wi-Fi uses less battery than mobile data. Connect to Wi-Fi when you are at home or in a place you trust.
- If you do not need it, turn off Bluetooth when not in use.
- Avoid extreme temperatures. Very hot or very cold weather makes batteries drain faster.
