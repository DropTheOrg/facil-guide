## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up Orange Money on your phone, add money to your account, send money to family and friends, and pay for things using your mobile phone. Orange Money is available in many African countries including Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Cameroon.

## What you need

- A phone (smartphone or basic phone) with an Orange SIM card
- Your national ID card
- An Orange Money agent nearby (to deposit cash) or an Orange store

## The steps

### Step 1: Register for Orange Money

If you have not registered yet, visit the nearest **Orange store** or **Orange Money agent** with your **national ID card**. They will activate Orange Money on your phone number and help you create a **secret PIN code**. Choose a PIN you can remember but that others cannot guess. Do not use your birthday or 1234.

### Step 2: Open Orange Money on your phone

If you have a smartphone, download the **Orange Money** app from the **Google Play Store** or **App Store**. Open the app and log in with your phone number and PIN. If you have a basic phone, dial **#144#** (the code may vary by country -- check with your local Orange). A menu will appear on your screen.

### Step 3: Add money to your account

To add money, visit an **Orange Money agent** (look for the orange signs in shops and markets). Give the agent the cash you want to deposit and your phone number. The agent will process the deposit and you will receive a confirmation message. Check your balance to make sure the money arrived.

### Step 4: Check your balance

On the app, tap **My Account** or **Balance** to see how much money you have. On a basic phone, dial **#144#** and select **Check Balance** from the menu. Enter your PIN when asked. Your balance will appear on the screen.

### Step 5: Send money to someone

On the app, tap **Transfer** or **Send Money**. Enter the recipient's phone number and the amount you want to send. Review the details and the fee that will be charged. Confirm the transaction by entering your **PIN**. Both you and the recipient will receive a confirmation message. On a basic phone, dial **#144#** and select **Transfer** from the menu.

### Step 6: Pay a bill or make a purchase

On the app, tap **Pay** or **Payments**. You can pay electricity bills, water bills, TV subscriptions, and buy airtime. Select the type of payment, enter the required details (like your customer number), and confirm with your **PIN**. On a basic phone, dial **#144#** and select **Payments** from the menu.

### Step 7: Withdraw cash from your account

To get cash out of your Orange Money account, visit an **Orange Money agent**. Tell them you want to make a withdrawal. On your phone, initiate the withdrawal through the app or by dialing **#144#** and selecting **Withdrawal**. Enter the agent's number and the amount. Confirm with your PIN. Show the confirmation to the agent, who will give you the cash.

## Tips

- Never share your PIN with anyone, even if they say they work for Orange. Orange employees will never ask for your PIN.
- Keep your confirmation messages as receipts. They are proof of your transactions.
- Start with a small amount to practice before sending larger sums.
- If you receive a message or call asking you to share your PIN or send money to claim a prize, it is a scam. Ignore it.
- Lock your phone with a passcode to protect your Orange Money if your phone is lost or stolen.
