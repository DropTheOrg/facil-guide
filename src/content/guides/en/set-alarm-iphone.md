## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set an alarm on your iPhone using the Clock app. This is useful for waking up in the morning, remembering to take medication, or any other time-based reminder.

## What you need

- An iPhone
- The Clock app (it comes pre-installed on every iPhone)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Clock app

Find the **Clock** app on your home screen. It has a white icon with a clock face. Tap it to open. If you cannot find it, swipe down on your home screen and type "Clock" in the search bar.

### Step 2: Go to the Alarm tab

At the bottom of the screen, you will see several tabs: **World Clock**, **Alarm**, **Stopwatch**, and **Timer**. Tap **"Alarm"** to see your list of alarms.

### Step 3: Create a new alarm

Tap the **"+"** button in the top right corner of the screen. This opens the alarm creation screen where you can set the time and other options.

### Step 4: Set the time

You will see a spinning wheel (called a picker) that lets you choose the hour and minutes. Scroll up or down to select the time you want the alarm to go off. Make sure you choose **AM** (morning) or **PM** (afternoon/evening) correctly.

### Step 5: Choose repeat days and sound

Tap **"Repeat"** if you want this alarm to go off on the same days every week (for example, every weekday). Tap **"Sound"** to pick the alarm tone you prefer. You can also tap **"Label"** to give your alarm a name like "Wake up" or "Take medicine".

### Step 6: Save the alarm

Tap **"Save"** in the top right corner. Your alarm now appears in the list with a green switch next to it, which means it is active. When the alarm goes off, swipe the screen or tap **"Stop"** to turn it off.

## Helpful tips

- **Snooze**: When your alarm goes off, tap **"Snooze"** to be reminded again in 9 minutes. To disable snooze, turn off the **"Snooze"** option when creating the alarm.
- **Bedtime volume**: Make sure your phone volume is high enough. Press the volume up button on the side of your iPhone.
- **Delete an alarm**: Swipe left on an alarm in the list and tap **"Delete"** to remove it permanently.
- **Use Siri**: You can also say "Hey Siri, set an alarm for 7 AM" to create an alarm without opening the app.
