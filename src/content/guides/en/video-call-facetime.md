faq:
  - question: "Is FaceTime free?"
    answer: "Yes, FaceTime is completely free. It uses your internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data), not your phone minutes. If you are on mobile data, it will use some of your data allowance."
  - question: "Can I FaceTime someone who has an Android phone?"
    answer: "Not directly from the FaceTime app. FaceTime only works between Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac). To video call someone with an Android phone, use WhatsApp, Google Meet, or Zoom instead."
  - question: "Why is my FaceTime video blurry?"
    answer: "This usually means your internet connection is slow. Try moving closer to your Wi-Fi router, or switch from mobile data to Wi-Fi. Also make sure your camera lens is clean."
  - question: "Can I FaceTime without showing my face?"
    answer: "Yes. You can make an audio-only FaceTime call by selecting the phone icon instead of the video icon. You can also turn off your camera during a video call by tapping the camera button."

## What You Will Need

- An iPhone or iPad
- A Wi-Fi or mobile data connection
- The other person must also have an Apple device (iPhone, iPad, or Mac)

## Step 1: Open the FaceTime App

Find the **FaceTime** app on your home screen. It is a green icon with a white video camera.

Tap it to open.

## Step 2: Choose Who to Call

At the top of the screen, tap **New FaceTime** or the **+** button.

Type the **name** or **phone number** of the person you want to call. Their name will appear below the search box. Tap their name.

You can also find them in your recent calls list and tap their name there.

## Step 3: Start the Video Call

You will see two buttons:

- **Video** (camera icon) -- for a video call
- **Audio** (phone icon) -- for a voice-only call

Tap the **Video** button to start the video call. Your phone will ring the other person.

Wait for them to answer. You will see your own face in a small window in the corner, and their face will fill the screen.

## Step 4: End the Call

When you are finished talking, tap the **red button** at the bottom of the screen to hang up.

**During the call, you can also:**
- **Mute your microphone:** Tap the microphone icon
- **Turn off your camera:** Tap the camera icon
- **Flip the camera:** Tap the flip icon to show what is in front of you instead of your face

## You Did It!

You made a FaceTime video call. It is a great way to see family and friends, especially if they live far away.
