## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to take a screenshot on your iPhone. A screenshot is a photo of whatever is currently shown on your screen. It is useful for saving information, sharing what you see, or keeping a record of something.

## What you need

- An iPhone (any model)

## The steps

### Step 1: Find the right buttons

The buttons you press depend on your iPhone model.

**If your iPhone has Face ID (no Home button):** You will use the **Side button** (on the right side) and the **Volume Up button** (on the left side).

**If your iPhone has a Home button:** You will use the **Home button** (the round button at the bottom of the screen) and the **Side button** (or Top button on older models).

### Step 2: Go to what you want to capture

Open the app or screen you want to save as a screenshot. Everything visible on your screen will be captured.

### Step 3: Press both buttons at the same time

**For Face ID iPhones:** Press the **Side button** and the **Volume Up button** at the same time, then release both quickly.

**For Home button iPhones:** Press the **Home button** and the **Side button** at the same time, then release both quickly.

You will hear a camera shutter sound (if your phone is not on silent) and the screen will flash white for a moment.

### Step 4: Find the preview

A small preview of your screenshot will appear in the **bottom left corner** of the screen. You can tap on it to edit the screenshot, or simply wait a few seconds and it will disappear on its own.

### Step 5: Find your screenshot in Photos

Open the **Photos** app. Your screenshot will be the most recent photo. You can also find all your screenshots in the **"Screenshots"** album by tapping **"Albums"** at the bottom of the Photos app.

## Helpful tips

- **Edit before saving**: Tap the small preview that appears after taking a screenshot. You can crop it, draw on it, or add text.
- **Share directly**: From the preview, tap the **share icon** (a square with an arrow pointing up) to send the screenshot via WhatsApp, email, or message.
- **Silent mode**: If you do not want the shutter sound, put your iPhone on silent using the switch on the left side of the phone.
