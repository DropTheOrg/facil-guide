  - question: "Will clearing my history log me out of websites?"
    answer: "If you clear cookies and website data, yes -- you will be logged out of most websites and will need to sign in again. If you only clear browsing history, your logins usually stay."
  - question: "Will clearing history delete my bookmarks?"
    answer: "No. Bookmarks and saved favorites are not affected when you clear your browsing history. They will still be there."
  - question: "How often should I clear my history?"
    answer: "There is no fixed rule. Some people clear it weekly for privacy, others only when their browser feels slow. If you share your phone with others, clearing history more often helps protect your privacy."
  - question: "Does clearing history free up storage space?"
    answer: "Yes, a small amount. Clearing cached data and cookies can free up some storage, especially if you have not done it in a long time. It will not free a large amount, but every bit helps."
  - question: "Can someone still see my history after I clear it?"
    answer: "After clearing, the history is removed from your phone. However, your internet provider or employer (if you use their network) may still have records. For more privacy, use private browsing mode."

## What you will learn

You will learn how to clear your browsing history, cookies, and cached data in Safari (iPhone) and Google Chrome (Android and iPhone). This helps protect your privacy and can fix some browser problems.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- Safari or Google Chrome browser

### Step 1: Clear history in Safari (iPhone)

Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone. Scroll down and tap **Apps**, then tap **Safari**. Scroll down to find **Clear History and Website Data**. Tap it. A message will ask you to confirm. Tap **Clear History** to delete your browsing history, cookies, and cached data.

### Step 2: Choose what to clear in Safari

If you want more control, open the **Safari** app. Tap the **book icon** at the bottom of the screen, then tap the **clock icon** to see your history. Tap **Clear** at the bottom and choose a time range: **Last Hour**, **Today**, **Today and Yesterday**, or **All Time**. This lets you delete only recent history instead of everything.

### Step 3: Clear history in Chrome (Android or iPhone)

Open the **Chrome** app. Tap the **three dots** icon in the top-right corner (Android) or bottom-right corner (iPhone). Tap **History**, then tap **Clear Browsing Data**.

### Step 4: Choose what to delete in Chrome

You will see checkboxes for different types of data: **Browsing History**, **Cookies and Site Data**, and **Cached Images and Files**. Check the boxes for what you want to delete. At the top, choose a time range: **Last Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 7 Days**, **Last 4 Weeks**, or **All Time**. Tap **Clear Data** to confirm.

### Step 5: Use private browsing to avoid saving history

If you do not want your browsing history saved in the first place, use private browsing mode. In Safari, tap the **tabs icon** at the bottom-right, then tap **Private**. In Chrome, tap the **three dots** icon and select **New Incognito Tab**. Websites you visit in private mode are not saved to your history.

### Step 6: Clear data for a single website

Sometimes you only need to clear data for one website. In Safari, go to **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Safari**, then **Advanced**, then **Website Data**. Find the website and swipe left to delete its data. In Chrome, go to **Settings**, then **Privacy and Security**, then **Clear Browsing Data**, or visit the site and tap the lock icon in the address bar to manage its permissions and data.

## Tips

- Clear your history before lending your phone to someone else
- Use private browsing mode when searching for personal topics like health or finances
- If a website is not loading correctly, clearing cookies and cached data for that site often fixes the problem
- Remember that clearing cookies will log you out of websites -- make sure you know your passwords before clearing
- Set a reminder to clear your history regularly if privacy is important to you
