## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to record and send voice messages on WhatsApp. Voice messages are a quick way to communicate when you do not want to type, and they add a personal touch that text messages cannot.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- WhatsApp installed and set up
- A working microphone (built into your phone)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open a conversation

Open **WhatsApp** and tap on the conversation with the person or group you want to send a voice message to.

### Step 2: Find the microphone button

Look at the bottom right corner of the screen, next to the message box. You will see a **microphone icon**. This is the button you use to record a voice message.

### Step 3: Record your message

Press and hold the **microphone icon** with your finger. While holding it, speak clearly into your phone. You will see a timer counting the seconds and a red recording indicator. Keep holding the button for the entire duration of your message.

### Step 4: Send the message

When you are finished speaking, **lift your finger** off the microphone button. The voice message will be sent immediately. You will see it appear in the conversation as a small audio bar that the other person can play.

### Step 5: Use hands-free recording (optional)

For longer messages, you do not need to hold the button the entire time. Start by pressing and holding the **microphone icon**, then **swipe up** toward the lock icon that appears. This locks the recording so you can let go of the screen. When finished, tap the **blue send button** (arrow icon) to send, or tap the **trash can** icon to delete it.

## Helpful tips

- **Cancel a recording**: If you change your mind while recording, **swipe left** on the microphone button. The recording will be deleted and nothing will be sent.
- **Listen before sending**: When using the locked recording mode, tap the **play button** to listen to your message before sending it.
- **Playback speed**: The person receiving your message can tap the speed button (1x, 1.5x, 2x) to listen faster. You can do the same with messages you receive.
- **Privacy**: If you hold the phone to your ear like a phone call, the voice message will play through the earpiece instead of the speaker, so only you can hear it.
