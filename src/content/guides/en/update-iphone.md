## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to check for software updates on your iPhone and install them. Keeping your iPhone updated gives you the latest features, fixes problems, and protects you from security threats.

## What you need

- An iPhone
- A Wi-Fi connection (updates are large and cannot be downloaded using mobile data)
- At least 50% battery or your charger plugged in
- Enough free storage space (usually 2-5 GB)

## The steps

### Step 1: Connect to Wi-Fi

Make sure your iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network. Updates are too large to download over mobile data. If you are not connected, go to **Settings** then **Wi-Fi** and tap your network name.

### Step 2: Open Settings

Tap the **Settings** app on your home screen. It has a gray icon that looks like gears.

### Step 3: Go to Software Update

Scroll down and tap **"General"**. Then tap **"Software Update"**. Your iPhone will check if a new update is available. This may take a few seconds.

### Step 4: Read about the update

If an update is available, you will see its name and a description of what is new. Read this to understand what changes the update will bring. If you see "Your software is up to date", your iPhone already has the latest version and you do not need to do anything.

### Step 5: Download and install

Tap **"Download and Install"**. Your iPhone may ask you to enter your passcode (the number you use to unlock your phone). Enter it. The download will begin. You can see the progress bar on the screen.

### Step 6: Wait for the update to finish

Once the download is complete, your iPhone will restart and install the update. You will see the Apple logo and a progress bar. Do not turn off your phone during this process. When the update is done, your phone will turn back on and ask you to enter your passcode.

## Helpful tips

- **Charge your phone**: Plug in your charger before starting the update. If your battery is below 50%, the update will not start.
- **Update at night**: You can schedule updates to install overnight. When the update screen appears, tap **"Install Tonight"** and your iPhone will update while you sleep.
- **Automatic updates**: Go to **Settings** then **General** then **Software Update** then **Automatic Updates** to have your iPhone download and install updates automatically.
- **Back up first**: Before any major update, back up your iPhone to iCloud or your computer. Go to **Settings** then tap your name at the top, then **iCloud** then **iCloud Backup**.
