## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up Google Pay on your Android phone and use it to pay in stores. Instead of carrying your bank card, you hold your phone near the card reader to pay. It is quick, easy, and secure.

## What you need

- An Android phone with NFC (most modern phones have this)
- A bank card (debit or credit) from a supported bank
- A Google account signed in on your phone
- A screen lock set up (PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock)

## The steps

### Step 1: Download Google Wallet

Open the **Google Play Store** on your phone. Search for **"Google Wallet"** (this is the app used for Google Pay). Tap **"Install"** if it is not already on your phone. Once installed, open the app.

### Step 2: Sign in and get started

The app will ask you to sign in with your **Google account**. Use the same account you use on your phone. Tap **"Get started"** or **"Add to Wallet"**.

### Step 3: Add your bank card

Tap **"Add a card"** or the **"+"** button. Choose **"Payment card"**. You can hold your card in front of the camera to scan it automatically, or tap **"Enter details manually"** to type the card number, expiration date, and security code.

### Step 4: Accept your bank's terms

Read and accept the terms from your bank. Your bank needs to verify that you own the card.

### Step 5: Verify your card

Your bank will send a verification code by text message, email, or phone call. Enter this code in the app when asked. Some banks verify automatically through their own app.

### Step 6: Make sure NFC is turned on

NFC is the technology that lets your phone communicate with the card reader. To check:

1. Open **Settings** on your phone
2. Search for **"NFC"** using the search bar at the top
3. Make sure the **NFC** switch is turned **on**

### Step 7: Pay in a store

When you are ready to pay:

1. Unlock your phone (use your fingerprint, PIN, or face)
2. Hold the **back of your phone** near the **card reader** (the machine where you would normally tap your card)
3. Wait for a checkmark or confirmation sound

You do not need to open the app. Just unlock your phone and hold it near the reader.

## Helpful tips

- **Default card**: The first card you add becomes your default. To change it, open Google Wallet, tap the card you want, and tap **"Set as default"**.
- **Multiple cards**: You can add several cards and choose which one to use.
- **Check if a store accepts it**: Look for the **contactless payment symbol** (four curved lines) or the **Google Pay logo** near the card reader.
- **Transaction history**: Open Google Wallet to see your recent payments.
- **Samsung phones**: Samsung phones also have Samsung Pay, which works similarly. You can use either app.
