faq:
  - question: "Can I copy and paste images too?"
    answer: "It depends on the app. In some apps, you can press and hold an image to see a Copy option. You can then paste it into a message or email. Not all apps support this."
  - question: "Why can I not select text on some screens?"
    answer: "Some apps and websites do not allow text selection. If pressing and holding does not highlight the text, the app has disabled copying on that screen."
  - question: "Does copied text stay on my clipboard forever?"
    answer: "No. The copied text stays on your clipboard until you copy something else or restart your phone. Some Android phones have a clipboard history that saves multiple items."
  - question: "Can I paste the same text multiple times?"
    answer: "Yes. After copying text once, you can paste it as many times as you want. It stays on your clipboard until you copy something new."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to copy text from one place on your phone and paste it somewhere else. This is useful for sharing addresses, phone numbers, links, or any text without having to type it out again.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)

## The steps

### Step 1: Find the text you want to copy

Open the app, message, website, or document that contains the text you want to copy. It could be a web address, a phone number, a paragraph, or even a single word.

### Step 2: Press and hold on the text

Place your finger on the text you want to copy and **press and hold** for about one second. Do not tap quickly -- hold your finger down. You will see the text become highlighted in blue or with small handles appearing around it.

### Step 3: Adjust the selection

After the text is highlighted, you will see two small **handles** (circles or lines) at the beginning and end of the selection. **Drag these handles** to select exactly the text you want. Drag the left handle to where you want the selection to start, and the right handle to where you want it to end.

### Step 4: Tap Copy

Once you have selected the text you want, a small menu will appear above or below the selection. Tap **Copy**. The text is now saved to your clipboard (a temporary storage area on your phone). Nothing visible will happen, but the text is copied.

### Step 5: Paste the text where you want it

Go to the place where you want to put the text -- a message, an email, a note, or a search bar. Tap the text field to place your cursor there. Then **press and hold** on the empty field for about one second. A menu will appear. Tap **Paste**. The text you copied will appear.

## Tips

- To select all the text in a field quickly, tap **Select All** from the menu that appears after pressing and holding.
- On iPhone, you can also shake your phone to undo a paste if you make a mistake.
- On Samsung phones, the keyboard often has a **clipboard** button that shows everything you have copied recently.
- Practice with a simple text message first until you feel comfortable.
