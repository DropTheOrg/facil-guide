## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to make a video call with FaceTime on your iPhone. A video call lets you see the person you are talking to, as if they were right in front of you.

## What you need

- An iPhone
- An Internet connection (Wi-Fi recommended for better quality)
- The person you are calling must also have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac

## The steps

### Step 1: Open FaceTime

Look for the green FaceTime icon on your home screen. It looks like a white video camera on a green background. **Tap on it once** to open the app.

### Step 2: Tap "New FaceTime"

At the top of the screen, you will see a **"New FaceTime"** button. Tap on it.

### Step 3: Type the name or number

In the search area at the top, **type the name of the person** you want to call. If this person is in your contacts, their name will appear automatically. Tap on their name to select them.

You can also type their phone number directly.

### Step 4: Start the video call

Tap the green **"FaceTime"** button to start the video call. Your phone will ring on the other person's device.

While you wait, you will see your own face on the screen. This is normal -- it is what the other person will see when they answer.

### Step 5: Enjoy your call

When the person answers, you will see them large on your screen. Your own image will appear small in a corner.

**To hang up**, tap the **red button** at the bottom of the screen.

## Helpful tips

- **Hold your phone upright**: Hold your iPhone vertically, at face level, so the other person can see you well.
- **Good lighting**: Position yourself facing a light source (a window, for example) so your face is well lit.
- **Wi-Fi preferred**: Video calls use a lot of data. Connect to Wi-Fi if possible.
- **Turn off the camera**: If you do not want to be seen, you can tap the camera icon to turn it off during the call.
