## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to create a Google account. A Google account gives you access to many free services, including Gmail (email), YouTube (videos), Google Maps (directions), and the Google Play Store (apps for Android phones).

## What you need

- A computer, phone, or tablet with Internet access
- A phone number (for verification)

## The steps

### Step 1: Go to the Google account page

Open your web browser and go to **[accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)**. Click on **"Create account"**. Select **"For my personal use"**.

### Step 2: Enter your name

Type your **first name** and **last name** in the fields provided. Then click **"Next"**.

### Step 3: Choose your birthday and gender

Enter your **date of birth** and select your **gender** from the dropdown menu. This information helps Google keep your account secure. Click **"Next"**.

### Step 4: Choose your email address

Google will suggest some email addresses based on your name. You can pick one of the suggestions or create your own by selecting **"Create your own Gmail address"**. Type an address you like (for example, maria.silva123). Click **"Next"**.

If the address you want is already taken, Google will ask you to try a different one.

### Step 5: Create a password

Type a **password** that is at least 8 characters long. Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols to make it strong. Type it again in the **"Confirm"** field. Click **"Next"**.

Write your password down on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere safe.

### Step 6: Verify your phone number

Google will ask for your **phone number** to verify your identity. Enter your number and click **"Next"**. You will receive a text message with a code. Type the code on the screen and click **"Verify"**.

After verification, review the terms and click **"I agree"**. Your Google account is now ready to use.

## Helpful tips

- **Recovery email**: Add a recovery email address in your account settings. This helps you get back into your account if you forget your password.
- **Two-step verification**: For extra security, turn on two-step verification in your Google account settings. This sends a code to your phone every time you sign in from a new device.
- **Remember your details**: Write down your full email address (including @gmail.com) and password. Keep them in a safe place.
