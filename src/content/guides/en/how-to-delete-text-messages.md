  - question: "Can I get deleted messages back?"
    answer: "On iPhone, recently deleted messages may be in the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days. On most Android phones, once deleted they are gone permanently."

    answer: "In the Messages app, tap Edit (iPhone) or the three dots menu (Android), then select multiple conversations and delete them."

Open a conversation. **Press and hold** the specific message you want to delete. A menu will appear. Tap **Delete** or the trash icon. Confirm by tapping **Delete** again.

## Step 3: Delete an entire conversation

Go back to the main Messages list. **Swipe left** on the conversation you want to delete (iPhone) or **press and hold** the conversation (Android). Tap **Delete**. The entire conversation will be removed.

## Step 4: Delete multiple conversations

Tap **Edit** at the top (iPhone) or the three dots menu (Android). Select the conversations you want to remove by tapping the circles next to them. Then tap **Delete** to remove them all at once.
