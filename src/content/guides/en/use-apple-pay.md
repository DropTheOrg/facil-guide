## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up Apple Pay on your iPhone and use it to pay in stores. Instead of using a physical bank card, you hold your phone near the card reader to pay. It is fast, simple, and secure.

## What you need

- An iPhone 6 or newer
- A bank card (debit or credit) from a supported bank
- Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode set up on your phone

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Wallet app

Find and tap the **Wallet** app on your home screen. It has an icon that looks like a wallet with colorful cards inside. If you cannot find it, swipe down on your home screen and type **"Wallet"** in the search bar.

### Step 2: Tap the plus button to add a card

In the Wallet app, tap the **"+"** button in the top right corner. Then tap **"Debit or Credit Card"** and tap **"Continue"**.

### Step 3: Scan your bank card

Hold your bank card in front of the camera so the phone can read the card number automatically. If the camera does not recognize your card, tap **"Enter Card Details Manually"** and type the card number, expiration date, and security code yourself.

### Step 4: Verify your card

Your bank needs to confirm that you are the card owner. You will usually receive a verification code by text message or email. Enter this code when asked.

### Step 5: Wait for activation

After verification, your bank will activate the card for Apple Pay. This usually takes just a few seconds. You will see a message saying your card is ready to use.

### Step 6: Pay in a store

When you are ready to pay at a store:

**If your iPhone has Face ID:** Double-press the **Side button**, look at your phone to confirm with Face ID, then hold the top of your phone near the **card reader** (the machine where you would normally tap your card).

**If your iPhone has Touch ID:** Hold your phone near the card reader with your finger on the **Home button** to confirm with your fingerprint.

You will feel a gentle vibration and see a checkmark on the screen when the payment is complete.

### Step 7: Check your payment history

Open the **Wallet** app and tap on your card. You will see a list of recent payments made with Apple Pay.

## Helpful tips

- **Default card**: The first card you add becomes your default payment card. To change it, go to **Settings** then **Wallet & Apple Pay** then **Default Card**.
- **Multiple cards**: You can add several cards to Apple Pay and choose which one to use before paying.
- **Works with Apple Watch**: If you have an Apple Watch, you can also pay by double-pressing the side button on the watch and holding it near the reader.
- **Look for the symbol**: In stores, look for the contactless payment symbol (four curved lines, like a sideways Wi-Fi icon) on the card reader. This means Apple Pay is accepted.
