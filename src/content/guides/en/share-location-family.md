faq:
  - question: "Does sharing my location drain my battery?"
    answer: "It uses a small amount of extra battery, but modern phones handle it efficiently. You should not notice a big difference in daily battery life."
  - question: "Can I stop sharing my location at any time?"
    answer: "Yes. You can stop sharing at any time from the same app you used to start sharing. The other person will be notified that you stopped sharing."
  - question: "Is my location shared with anyone other than the people I choose?"
    answer: "No. Only the specific people you invite can see your location. Apple and Google do not share your location with others."
  - question: "How accurate is the location shown?"
    answer: "When your phone has a good GPS signal and internet connection, the location is usually accurate to within a few meters. Indoors, it may be less precise."
  - question: "Does the other person need the same type of phone?"
    answer: "For Apple Find My, both people need an iPhone. For Google Maps location sharing, it works between any phones as long as both have Google Maps installed."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to share your real-time location with a family member so they can see where you are on a map. This is useful for safety, especially when traveling alone or for keeping track of elderly family members.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- The family member's phone number or email address
- Both phones connected to the internet

## The steps

### Step 1: Choose which app to use

On iPhone, the built-in app is called **Find My**. On Android, you can use **Google Maps**. Both apps are free and already installed on most phones. You can also use WhatsApp for a simpler option that works on both iPhone and Android.

### Step 2: Share your location using Find My on iPhone

Open the **Find My** app (it has a green radar icon). Tap **People** at the bottom. Tap the **plus icon** and choose **Share My Location**. Type the name or phone number of the family member you want to share with. Choose how long to share: **Share for One Hour**, **Share Until End of Day**, or **Share Indefinitely**. Tap **Send**.

### Step 3: Share your location using Google Maps on Android

Open **Google Maps**. Tap your **profile picture** in the top right corner. Tap **Location sharing**. Tap **Share location** and choose how long to share. Select the contact you want to share with or copy a link to send via message. Tap **Share**.

### Step 4: Share your location using WhatsApp (any phone)

Open **WhatsApp** and go to the chat with the family member. Tap the **plus icon** or **paperclip icon** at the bottom. Tap **Location**. Choose **Share Live Location**. Select how long to share: 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours. Add a message if you want and tap **Send**.

### Step 5: Ask your family member to share their location too

For the sharing to work both ways, ask the family member to follow the same steps on their phone. This way, you can both see each other on the map at any time.

### Step 6: View the shared location

On iPhone, open **Find My** and tap **People** to see your family member on the map. On Google Maps, tap your **profile picture**, then **Location sharing** to see shared locations. On WhatsApp, open the chat and tap the live location message to see it on a map.

## Tips

- Share your location before going on a trip so your family knows you arrived safely.
- For elderly family members, set the sharing to **Indefinitely** or **Share Until End of Day** so they do not need to set it up repeatedly.
- Make sure location services are turned on in your phone settings, or the sharing will not work.
- If you are concerned about privacy, remember you can stop sharing at any time.
