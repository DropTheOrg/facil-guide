faq:
  - question: "What is the difference between Wi-Fi and mobile data?"
    answer: "Wi-Fi connects your phone to the internet through a router (like at home or a cafe). Mobile data uses your phone plan. Wi-Fi is usually free and faster."
  - question: "Why does it ask for a password?"
    answer: "Most Wi-Fi networks are protected with a password to keep them secure. Ask the owner of the network for the password."
  - question: "Will my phone remember the Wi-Fi password?"
    answer: "Yes. Once you connect to a Wi-Fi network, your phone saves the password and connects automatically next time you're nearby."
