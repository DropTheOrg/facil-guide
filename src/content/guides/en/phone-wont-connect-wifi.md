  - question: "Will I lose anything if I forget the Wi-Fi network?"
    answer: "No. Forgetting a network only removes the saved password from your phone. You will not lose any photos, apps, or data. You will just need to type the Wi-Fi password again."
  - question: "Why does my phone connect to Wi-Fi but have no Internet?"
    answer: "This can happen if your router is connected to Wi-Fi but has lost its Internet connection. Try restarting your router. If the problem continues, contact your Internet provider."
  - question: "What if I don't know my Wi-Fi password?"
    answer: "The Wi-Fi password is usually printed on a sticker on the back or bottom of your router. If someone changed it, ask them for the new password."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn what to do when your phone will not connect to Wi-Fi. Whether the connection keeps failing, the password is not accepted, or the network does not appear at all, these steps will help you get back online.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- Your Wi-Fi network name and password (usually on a sticker on your router)

## The steps

### Step 1: Turn Wi-Fi off and on again

This simple step fixes the problem more often than you might expect.

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi**. Turn the switch **off**, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back **on**.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi** (or **Connections** > **Wi-Fi**). Turn the switch **off**, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back **on**.

Your phone will search for available networks. Tap on your Wi-Fi network name and enter the password if asked.

### Step 2: Move closer to the router

Wi-Fi signals get weaker the farther you are from the router. Move to the same room as the router and try connecting again. Thick walls, microwaves, and other electronics can also interfere with the signal.

### Step 3: Forget the network and reconnect

If your phone remembers an old or incorrect password, it will keep failing to connect. You need to make it forget the network and start fresh.

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi**. Tap the small blue **"i"** icon next to your network name. Tap **"Forget This Network"**, then confirm. Now tap on the network again and carefully type your password.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **Wi-Fi**. Press and hold on your network name (or tap the gear icon next to it). Tap **"Forget"** or **"Remove"**. Then tap the network again and enter your password.

### Step 4: Restart your phone

If forgetting the network did not help, restart your phone. This clears temporary problems that can block the Wi-Fi connection.

**On iPhone:** Press and hold the **Side button** and a **Volume button**, slide to power off, wait 10 seconds, turn back on.

**On Android:** Press and hold the **Power button**, tap **Restart**.

### Step 5: Restart your router

If your phone still will not connect (and other devices also have trouble), the problem may be with the router itself.

Find your router and **unplug it from the power outlet**. Wait **30 seconds**. Plug it back in. Wait about 2 minutes for it to fully start up (the lights will stop blinking). Then try connecting your phone again.

### Step 6: Reset network settings

If nothing else works, you can reset all network settings on your phone. This erases all saved Wi-Fi passwords and Bluetooth connections, but does not delete any photos, apps, or data.

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone** > **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings**. Enter your passcode to confirm.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **General Management** > **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings**. Confirm the reset.

After the reset, reconnect to your Wi-Fi network by typing the password again.

## Helpful tips

- **Check the password carefully**: Wi-Fi passwords are case-sensitive. Make sure capital letters, numbers, and symbols are exactly right. The password is usually printed on a sticker on your router.
- **Too many devices**: Some routers struggle when too many devices are connected. If you have many smart devices, try disconnecting a few and then connecting your phone.
- **Contact your provider**: If restarting the router does not help and no devices can connect, your Internet service may be down. Call your Internet provider to check.
- **Public Wi-Fi**: At hotels, cafes, or airports, you may need to open your browser and accept terms on a login page before the Wi-Fi fully works.
