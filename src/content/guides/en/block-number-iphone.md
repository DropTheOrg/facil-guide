## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to block a phone number on your iPhone. Blocking a number stops that person from calling you, sending you text messages, or reaching you on FaceTime. This is useful for stopping spam calls or unwanted contacts.

## What you need

- An iPhone
- The phone number you want to block (either from a recent call or your contacts)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Phone app

Tap the green **Phone** icon on your home screen. It looks like a white telephone handset on a green background.

### Step 2: Find the number to block

Tap **"Recents"** at the bottom of the screen to see your recent calls. Find the number or contact you want to block in the list.

If the number is saved as a contact, you can also find it in the **"Contacts"** tab.

### Step 3: Tap the info button

Next to the phone number, tap the small **blue "i" icon** (information button) on the right side. This will open the details for that caller.

### Step 4: Scroll down and tap Block this Caller

Scroll down to the bottom of the screen. You will see a red text that says **"Block this Caller"**. Tap on it.

### Step 5: Confirm the block

A message will appear asking you to confirm. Tap **"Block Contact"** to finish. The number is now blocked and will no longer be able to call or message you.

## Helpful tips

- **Block from Messages**: You can also block a number from the Messages app. Open the conversation, tap the name at the top, tap the **info icon**, then scroll down to **"Block this Caller"**.
- **See your blocked list**: Go to **Settings**, then **Phone**, then **Blocked Contacts** to see everyone you have blocked.
- **Spam calls**: If you receive many spam calls, turn on **"Silence Unknown Callers"** in Settings > Phone. This sends calls from unknown numbers directly to voicemail.
