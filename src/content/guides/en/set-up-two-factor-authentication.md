  - question: "What is two-factor authentication?"
    answer: "Two-factor authentication is an extra security step when you log in. After typing your password, you also enter a code sent to your phone by text message or generated by an app. This means even if someone steals your password, they cannot get into your account without your phone."
  - question: "What happens if I lose my phone?"
    answer: "Most services give you backup codes when you set up two-factor authentication. Write these codes down and keep them in a safe place. You can use them to get into your account if you lose your phone."
  - question: "Do I need to enter a code every time I log in?"
    answer: "Not always. Many services let you mark a device as trusted, so you only need the code when logging in from a new device or browser. On your own phone or computer, you may only need it once."
  - question: "Is text message verification safe enough?"
    answer: "Text message codes are much safer than using just a password. An authenticator app is even more secure, but text messages are a good starting point and easy to set up."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up two-factor authentication on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security so that nobody can get into your accounts even if they know your password. You will receive a code on your phone each time you log in from a new device.

## What you need

- A phone that can receive text messages
- Access to your email, social media, or banking accounts
- A few minutes for each account you want to protect

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand why this matters

Every day, hackers try to steal passwords. If someone gets your password, they can read your emails, post on your social media, or even access your bank. Two-factor authentication stops them because they would also need your phone to get in. Think of it as a second lock on your front door.

### Step 2: Start with your email account

Your email is the most important account to protect because password reset links for other accounts are sent there. Open your email provider's website. For Gmail, go to **myaccount.google.com**, click **Security**, then click **2-Step Verification** and follow the steps. For other providers, look for **Security** or **Login settings** in your account settings.

### Step 3: Choose your verification method

You will be asked how you want to receive your codes. The two main options are **text message** (SMS) and **authenticator app**. Choose **text message** if you want the simplest option. Your phone number will receive a code by SMS each time you log in from a new device.

### Step 4: Verify your phone number

Enter your phone number when asked. The service will send a test code to your phone by text message. Open the text message, read the code (usually 6 digits), and type it into the website. This confirms that the phone number is yours and that you can receive codes.

### Step 5: Save your backup codes

After setting up, the service will show you **backup codes**. These are one-time codes you can use if you lose your phone. Write them down on paper and keep the paper somewhere safe, like in a drawer or with your important documents. Do not save them only on your phone.

### Step 6: Protect your social media accounts

Now do the same for your other important accounts. On Facebook, go to **Settings**, then **Security and Login**, then **Two-Factor Authentication**. On WhatsApp, go to **Settings**, then **Account**, then **Two-step verification**. On Instagram, go to **Settings**, then **Security**, then **Two-Factor Authentication**. The steps are similar for each one.

### Step 7: Protect your banking accounts

Check if your bank offers two-factor authentication. Most banks already require it for online banking. Log into your banking app or website, go to **Security settings**, and make sure two-factor authentication is turned on. If you are unsure, call your bank and ask them to help you set it up.

## Tips

- Start with your email account. If a hacker gets into your email, they can reset passwords for all your other accounts.
- If you receive a verification code that you did not request, do not share it with anyone. Someone may be trying to get into your account.
- Keep your phone number up to date on all your accounts. If you change your phone number, update it immediately.
- Write your backup codes on paper, not in a note on your phone. If you lose your phone, you will lose both.
