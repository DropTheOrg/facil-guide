## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up the NHS App on your phone and use it to manage your healthcare. The NHS App lets you book and cancel GP appointments, order repeat prescriptions, view your medical records, and access other NHS services without making phone calls or visiting the surgery in person.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- An email address
- Your GP surgery must be in England and connected to the NHS App
- A form of photo ID for identity verification (passport, driving licence, or European national identity card)

## The steps

### Step 1: Download the NHS App

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android) and search for **NHS App**. The icon is a white background with the blue NHS logo. Tap **Install** or **Get** to download it. Make sure you download the official app made by **NHS Digital**.

### Step 2: Create your NHS account

Open the **NHS App** and tap **Register now** or **Continue**. Enter your email address and create a password. The app will send a verification code to your email. Open your email, find the code, and enter it in the app to verify your address.

### Step 3: Verify your identity

The app needs to confirm who you are before giving you access to your health records. Tap **Continue** and follow the instructions. You will need to take a photo of your **passport** or **driving licence** using your phone camera, then take a short video of your face. The app compares the photo on your ID with your face to verify your identity. This usually takes a few minutes.

### Step 4: Connect to your GP surgery

After identity verification, the app will search for your GP surgery using your NHS number or personal details. Confirm your GP surgery when it appears. If your surgery supports the NHS App, you will be connected automatically. You may need to wait up to 24 hours for full access to be granted.

### Step 5: Book or manage GP appointments

Tap **Appointments** on the home screen. To book a new appointment, tap **Book an appointment**, choose the type of appointment you need, pick a date and time, and confirm. You can also see your upcoming appointments and cancel if needed by tapping on the appointment and selecting **Cancel**.

### Step 6: Order repeat prescriptions

Tap **Prescriptions** on the home screen. You will see a list of your repeat medications. Tick the medicines you need to reorder and tap **Request prescription**. Your GP surgery will process the request and send it to your chosen pharmacy. You will receive a notification when it is ready to collect.

### Step 7: View your health records

Tap **Health records** on the home screen. Here you can see your medical history, including past consultations, test results, allergies, vaccinations, and current medications. Tap any item to see more details. This information is pulled directly from your GP surgery's records.

## Tips

- If your GP surgery is not yet connected to the NHS App, ask them about it. Most surgeries in England now support the app.
- Use the **111 online** feature in the app if you need urgent medical advice but it is not an emergency. It guides you to the right service.
- You can nominate your preferred pharmacy in the app so prescriptions are automatically sent there.
- Check the app regularly for test results. Your GP may add results before they have time to call you.
