## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to take a screenshot on your Android phone. A screenshot is a photo of whatever is currently shown on your screen. It is useful for saving information, sharing something you see, or keeping a record.

## What you need

- An Android phone (any brand: Samsung, Google Pixel, Xiaomi, Huawei, or others)

## The steps

### Step 1: Go to what you want to capture

Open the app, message, or screen you want to save as a screenshot. Everything visible on your screen will be captured.

### Step 2: Find the right buttons

On most Android phones, you will use two buttons:

- The **Power button** (usually on the right side of the phone)
- The **Volume Down button** (usually on the left side or below the Power button)

### Step 3: Press both buttons at the same time

Press the **Power button** and the **Volume Down button** at the same time. Hold them for about one second, then release both.

Your screen will flash briefly and you may hear a camera shutter sound. This means the screenshot was taken successfully.

### Step 4: Find the preview or notification

After taking the screenshot, a small preview will appear at the bottom or top of your screen. You may also see a notification. Tap the preview to edit or share the screenshot right away.

### Step 5: Find your screenshot in the Gallery

Open your **Gallery** app or **Google Photos** app. Look for a folder or album called **"Screenshots"**. Your new screenshot will be there.

### Step 6: Alternative method using Quick Settings

If the button method is difficult, try this:

1. Swipe down from the **top of your screen** with two fingers to open **Quick Settings**
2. Look for a button labeled **"Screenshot"** or a small scissors icon
3. Tap it to capture the screen

Not all phones show this option by default, but many Samsung and Google Pixel phones include it.

## Helpful tips

- **Share quickly**: After taking a screenshot, tap the **Share** button on the preview notification to send it via WhatsApp, email, or message.
- **Samsung phones**: On some Samsung phones, you can also swipe the edge of your hand across the screen to take a screenshot. Enable this in **Settings** then **Advanced features** then **Motions and gestures**.
- **Google Assistant**: Say "Hey Google, take a screenshot" to capture the screen hands-free.
- **Scrolling screenshot**: On many modern Android phones, after taking a screenshot you will see a **"Capture more"** or **"Scroll capture"** button. Tap it to capture a long page that goes beyond what is visible.
