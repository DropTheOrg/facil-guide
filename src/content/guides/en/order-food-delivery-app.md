## What you will learn

You will learn how to download a food delivery app, set up your account, browse restaurants near you, place an order, and track your delivery. This guide uses general steps that work with most food delivery apps.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- An internet connection
- A payment method (credit card, debit card, or PayPal)
- Your home address

### Step 1: Download a food delivery app

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). Search for a food delivery app such as **Uber Eats**, **DoorDash**, or **Grubhub**. Tap **Get** or **Install** to download it.

### Step 2: Create an account

Open the app and tap **Sign Up** or **Get Started**. Enter your **name**, **email address**, and **phone number**. Create a **password**. The app may send a verification code to your phone -- enter it when asked.

### Step 3: Add your delivery address

The app will ask for your address. Type your **full home address** including apartment or unit number. This tells the app which restaurants can deliver to you. You can save this address for future orders.

### Step 4: Add a payment method

Tap your **profile icon** or go to **Settings**, then tap **Payment**. Tap **Add Payment Method** and enter your credit or debit card details. Your card information is stored securely in the app.

### Step 5: Browse restaurants and choose your food

The home screen shows restaurants near you. Scroll through the list or use the **search bar** to find a specific restaurant or type of food (like "pizza" or "Chinese"). Tap a restaurant to see its menu. Tap an item to add it to your cart. Choose any options like size or toppings, then tap **Add to Cart**.

### Step 6: Review your order and pay

When you have added everything you want, tap the **cart icon** (usually at the bottom of the screen). Review your items and the total price, which includes delivery and service fees. If everything looks correct, tap **Place Order** or **Checkout**. Confirm your address and payment method, then tap **Place Order**.

### Step 7: Track your delivery

After ordering, the app shows a live tracker. You can see when the restaurant starts preparing your food, when the driver picks it up, and when they are on the way. You will receive a notification when your food arrives at your door.

## Tips

- Check the estimated delivery time before ordering -- it varies by restaurant
- Read restaurant ratings and reviews from other customers before choosing
- You can add special instructions for the driver, like "leave at the door" or "ring the bell"
- Look for promotions or first-order discounts on the home screen
- Tip your delivery driver -- you can add a tip in the app after delivery
