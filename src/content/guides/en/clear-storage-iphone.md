## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to check how much storage space your iPhone has left and several ways to free up space. A full iPhone can run slowly, stop taking photos, and prevent app updates.

## What you need

- An iPhone

## The steps

### Step 1: Check your current storage

Open **Settings**, tap **"General"**, then tap **"iPhone Storage"**. Wait a few seconds for it to load. You will see a colored bar showing how much space is used and what types of files are using it (apps, photos, messages, and other).

### Step 2: Review recommendations

At the top of the iPhone Storage screen, Apple may show recommendations to save space. Common suggestions include **"Offload Unused Apps"**, **"Review Large Attachments"**, and **"Auto Delete Old Conversations"**. Tap any recommendation to enable it.

### Step 3: Delete large apps you do not use

Scroll down on the same screen to see a list of all your apps sorted by size. The biggest ones are at the top. For any app you no longer use, tap it and then tap **"Delete App"** to remove it and free up the space it was using.

### Step 4: Clear photos and videos

Open the **Photos** app. Look through your photos and delete any you no longer want by tapping the photo and then tapping the **trash can** icon. After deleting photos, go to **"Albums"** then **"Recently Deleted"** and tap **"Delete All"** to permanently remove them and reclaim the space.

### Step 5: Clear Safari browser data

Open **Settings**, scroll down and tap **"Safari"**. Scroll down and tap **"Clear History and Website Data"**. Tap **"Clear History and Data"** to confirm. This removes saved website files that take up space.

### Step 6: Remove old message attachments

Go to **Settings** then **"General"** then **"iPhone Storage"**. Tap **"Messages"**. You will see categories like **Photos**, **Videos**, **GIFs**, and **Stickers**. Tap a category, tap **"Edit"**, select the items you want to remove, and tap the **trash can** icon.

## Helpful tips

- **iCloud Photos**: Turn on **iCloud Photos** in Settings to store full-size photos in the cloud and keep only smaller versions on your phone. Go to **Settings** then tap your name, then **iCloud** then **Photos**.
- **Streaming over downloading**: Stream music and videos instead of downloading them to save storage space.
- **Regular cleanup**: Do this every few months to keep your iPhone running smoothly.
- **Check after cleaning**: Go back to **Settings** then **General** then **iPhone Storage** to see how much space you freed up.
