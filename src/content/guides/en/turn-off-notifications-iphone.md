  - question: "Will I miss important calls if I turn off notifications?"
    answer: "No. Turning off notifications for an app only stops that app's alerts. Phone calls will still come through unless you also enable Do Not Disturb."
  - question: "Can I turn notifications back on later?"
    answer: "Yes. Follow the same steps and turn the toggle back on for Allow Notifications."
  - question: "What is Do Not Disturb?"
    answer: "Do Not Disturb silences all notifications, calls, and alerts at once. You can turn it on from Settings or by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen and tapping the moon icon."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to turn off notifications for specific apps on your iPhone. This is useful when an app sends too many alerts and you want your phone to be quieter.

## What you need

- An iPhone (any model)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Settings

Find the **Settings** app on your home screen. It has an icon that looks like grey gears. Tap on it to open it.

### Step 2: Tap Notifications

Scroll down slightly and tap **Notifications**. This opens a list of all the apps installed on your iPhone.

### Step 3: Choose the app you want to silence

Scroll through the list and find the app whose notifications you want to turn off. For example, if you want to stop alerts from a game, find the game's name in the list and tap on it.

### Step 4: Turn off Allow Notifications

At the top of the screen, you will see a toggle next to **Allow Notifications**. Tap the toggle to turn it off. When the toggle is grey (not green), notifications from this app are disabled.

### Step 5: Repeat for other apps if needed

Press the back arrow in the top left corner to go back to the full list. You can repeat steps 3 and 4 for any other app you want to silence.

## Helpful tips

- **Quick method from lock screen**: When you see a notification on your lock screen, swipe it to the left. Tap **Options**, then tap **Turn Off** to disable notifications from that app instantly.
- **Scheduled summary**: Instead of turning notifications off completely, you can enable **Scheduled Summary** in the notification settings for an app. This groups alerts and shows them at a time you choose.
- **Focus mode**: If you want quiet time without turning off notifications permanently, try using **Focus** mode from the Control Center.
