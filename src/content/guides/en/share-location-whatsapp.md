faq:
  - question: "Is sharing my location on WhatsApp safe?"
    answer: "Your location is only shared with the person or group you choose. WhatsApp uses encryption, so no one else can see it. You can stop sharing at any time."
  - question: "What is the difference between Send Location and Live Location?"
    answer: "Send Location shares where you are at that moment only. Live Location shares your position in real time for a period you choose (15 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours)."
  - question: "Does sharing location use a lot of battery?"
    answer: "Live location sharing does use more battery than normal because your phone keeps updating your position. It stops automatically after the time you selected."
  - question: "Can I share my location in a group chat?"
    answer: "Yes. The steps are the same. Everyone in the group will be able to see your location."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to share your location with someone through WhatsApp. This is useful when meeting someone, letting family know where you are, or sharing directions to a place.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- WhatsApp installed and set up
- Location services turned on
- An Internet connection

## The steps

### Step 1: Open a WhatsApp conversation

Open **WhatsApp** and tap on the conversation with the person you want to share your location with. This can be a private chat or a group chat.

### Step 2: Tap the attachment button

Tap the **"+"** button (iPhone) or the **paperclip icon** (Android) next to the message box at the bottom of the screen. A menu of options will appear.

### Step 3: Tap Location

In the menu that appears, tap **"Location"**. If WhatsApp asks for permission to access your location, tap **"Allow While Using App"**. Your phone needs this to find where you are.

### Step 4: Choose your sharing option

You will see two options:
- **"Send Your Current Location"**: This sends a snapshot of where you are right now. The other person sees a map pin but your location does not update.
- **"Share Live Location"**: This shares your moving position in real time.

Choose the option that fits your situation.

### Step 5: Set the duration (for live location)

If you chose **"Share Live Location"**, you will be asked how long to share: **15 minutes**, **1 hour**, or **8 hours**. Tap the duration you prefer. You can optionally add a message (like "On my way").

### Step 6: Send your location

Tap **"Send"**. The other person will now see a map in the chat showing where you are. If you shared your live location, they will see your position update as you move.

To stop sharing your live location early, open the conversation, tap the location message, and tap **"Stop Sharing"**.

## Helpful tips

- **Check your location is accurate**: Before sharing, make sure the blue dot on the map matches where you actually are. Sometimes GPS takes a moment to find your exact position.
- **Share a place**: You can also search for a specific place (like a restaurant) in the location screen and send that instead of your own position.
- **Privacy**: Only share your live location with people you trust. You can stop it at any time.
- **Group meetups**: Live location is perfect for group meetups. Everyone in the group can share their live location so you can see each other on the map.
