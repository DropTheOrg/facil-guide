## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to check how much storage space is available on your Android phone. This tells you whether you have room for more photos, apps, and files.

## What you need

- An Android phone (Samsung, Google Pixel, Xiaomi, or any other Android device)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Settings

Find the **Settings** app on your home screen or in your app drawer. It has an icon that looks like a gear or cogwheel. Tap on it.

### Step 2: Find Storage

Scroll down the Settings menu and tap on **Storage**. On some phones, this may be under **Battery and device care** or **Device care** first, then tap **Storage**.

### Step 3: Read the storage summary

You will see a bar or circle showing how much space is used and how much is free. The total storage of your phone (such as 64 GB or 128 GB) will be shown, along with how much is currently used.

### Step 4: See what is using space

Below the summary, you will see a breakdown by category: **Apps**, **Images**, **Videos**, **Audio**, **Documents**, and **Other**. Tap on any category to see more details about what is using that space.

### Step 5: Take action if needed

If your storage is nearly full, you can tap on a category and delete items you no longer need. You can also tap **Free up space** or **Clean up** if your phone offers this option.

## Helpful tips

- **Google Photos backup**: If photos take up too much space, use **Google Photos** to back them up to the cloud, then delete the local copies.
- **Move apps to SD card**: If your phone has an SD card slot, some apps can be moved to the SD card to free up internal storage. Check in Settings under Apps.
- **Check regularly**: Make it a habit to check your storage once a month so your phone stays fast and you always have room for new things.
