## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use Google Maps on your phone to search for a place and get step-by-step directions to get there. This works for driving, walking, and public transport.

## What you need

- A smartphone (iPhone or Android)
- The Google Maps app installed (free from the App Store or Google Play)
- An Internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)
- Location services turned on

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Google Maps

Find the **Google Maps** app on your phone. It has a colorful map pin icon. Tap it to open the app. If you do not have it yet, open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android) and search for "Google Maps" to download it for free.

### Step 2: Allow location access

The first time you open Google Maps, it will ask permission to use your location. Tap **"Allow While Using App"**. This lets the app know where you are so it can give you directions from your current location.

### Step 3: Search for your destination

Tap the **search bar** at the top of the screen. Type the name of the place you want to go to (for example, "nearest pharmacy" or a specific address). A list of suggestions will appear. Tap the correct one.

### Step 4: Tap Directions

Once the place appears on the map, you will see a blue button that says **"Directions"** at the bottom of the screen. Tap it. Google Maps will calculate the best route from your current location.

### Step 5: Choose how you want to travel

At the top of the screen, you will see icons for different travel methods: **car**, **bus** (public transport), **walking** (a person), and **bicycle**. Tap the one you prefer. The estimated travel time will change based on your choice.

### Step 6: Start navigation

Tap the blue **"Start"** button at the bottom of the screen. Google Maps will now give you turn-by-turn directions with voice guidance. Follow the instructions on the screen and listen to the voice prompts. To stop navigation, tap the screen and then tap the **X** or **"Exit"** button.

## Helpful tips

- **Zoom in and out**: Use two fingers to pinch the screen to zoom in or out on the map.
- **Share your location**: You can share your real-time location with family by tapping your profile picture and selecting **"Location sharing"**.
- **Save favorite places**: Tap the **"Save"** button on any place to add it to your favorites for quick access later.
- **Check traffic**: The colored lines on roads show traffic conditions. Green means clear, yellow means slow, and red means heavy traffic.
