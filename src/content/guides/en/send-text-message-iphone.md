Find the **Messages** app on your home screen. It has a green icon with a white speech bubble. Tap on it.

When your message is ready, tap the **blue arrow button** to the right of the text field. Your message will be sent. You will see it appear in a blue or green bubble on the screen.

## Helpful tips

- **Voice-to-text**: If typing is difficult, tap and hold the **microphone icon** on the keyboard and speak your message. The phone will type it for you.
- **Delete a message**: Press and hold on a message bubble, then tap **More**, select the message, and tap the trash icon to delete it.
