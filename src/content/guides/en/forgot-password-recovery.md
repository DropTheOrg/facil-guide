## Step 1: Go to the login page

Open the website or app where you need to sign in. Look for the sign-in or login page where you normally type your email and password.

## Step 2: Click "Forgot password"

Below or near the password field, you will see a link that says **Forgot password?** or **Reset password** or **Need help signing in?**. Click or tap on that link.

## Step 3: Enter your email or phone number

The site will ask for the email address or phone number linked to your account. Type it carefully and click **Next** or **Submit**.

## Step 4: Check for a recovery message

The site will send you an email or a text message with a link or a code to reset your password. Open your email inbox or check your text messages. If you do not see it, check the **Spam** or **Junk** folder.

## Step 5: Create a new password

Click the link in the email or enter the code on the website. You will be asked to create a new password. Choose something you will remember. Type it twice to confirm, then click **Save** or **Reset password**. You can now sign in with your new password.
