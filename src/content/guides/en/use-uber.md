  - question: "How much does Uber cost?"
    answer: "The price depends on the distance, time of day, and demand. Before you confirm a ride, the app shows you the estimated price so there are no surprises."
  - question: "Do I need cash?"
    answer: "No. Uber charges the card you added to the app automatically after the ride. You do not need to give the driver any money."
  - question: "How do I know which car is mine?"
    answer: "After you request a ride, the app shows you the driver's name, photo, car color, car model, and license plate number. Match the license plate before getting in."
  - question: "Can I book a ride for someone else?"
    answer: "Yes. When entering the destination, look for the option 'Ride is for someone else.' You can enter their phone number so the driver contacts them instead."
  - question: "What if I left something in the car?"
    answer: "Open the Uber app, go to your trip history, select the ride, and tap 'I lost an item.' The app will help you contact the driver."

## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- The Uber app (free from App Store or Google Play)
- A payment method (credit card, debit card, or PayPal) added to your account

## Step 1: Download and Set Up Uber

If you do not have the app yet:

1. Go to the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Play Store** (Android)
2. Search for **Uber**
3. Tap **Get** or **Install**
4. Open the app and create an account with your phone number and email
5. Add a payment method (credit card, debit card, or PayPal)

## Step 2: Enter Your Destination

Open the Uber app. At the top, you will see a search box that says **Where to?**

Tap it and type where you want to go. For example: "Airport" or "123 Main Street."

Select the correct address from the suggestions.

## Step 3: Choose Your Ride Type

The app will show you different ride options:

- **UberX:** A regular car, the cheapest option
- **Uber Comfort:** A newer, more spacious car
- **Uber XL:** A larger vehicle for groups of 5-6 people

Each option shows the **estimated price** and **arrival time**. Tap the one you want.

## Step 4: Confirm Your Pickup Location

The app uses your phone's location to set where the car will pick you up. Check the map to make sure the pin is in the right spot.

If it is not correct, tap the pin and drag it to the right location, or type a specific address.

## Step 5: Request the Ride

Tap the **Confirm** button (or **Request UberX**).

The app will find a driver near you. You will see:

- **Driver's name and photo**
- **Car model, color, and license plate**
- **Estimated arrival time**

Wait at your pickup location. You can track the car on the map in real time.

## Step 6: Take Your Ride

When the car arrives:

1. **Check the license plate** matches what the app shows
2. **Confirm the driver's name** by asking "Are you [name]?"
3. Get in the car

The driver already knows where you are going. You do not need to give directions.

When you arrive, simply get out. The payment is automatic -- no cash needed.

## You Did It!

You booked and completed an Uber ride. The app saves your trip history and receipts, and you can rate your driver after the ride.
