## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up voicemail on your phone so that people can leave you a voice message when you are unable to answer a call. You will also learn how to listen to your voicemail messages, save them, or delete them.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone with an active mobile phone plan
- Your phone's PIN or passcode
- A quiet place to record your greeting

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Phone app

Tap the **Phone** icon on your home screen. It looks like a green telephone handset on iPhone, or a blue or green phone icon on Android. This is the same app you use to make regular phone calls.

### Step 2: Go to voicemail settings

On **iPhone**: tap the **Voicemail** tab in the bottom right corner of the Phone app. If this is your first time, you will see a **Set Up Now** button. Tap it.

On **Android**: open the **Phone** app, tap the three dots in the top right corner, then tap **Settings**. Look for **Voicemail** and tap it. You may need to scroll down to find it.

### Step 3: Create a voicemail PIN

Your phone will ask you to create a PIN (a short number code, usually 4 to 6 digits). This PIN protects your voicemail so only you can listen to your messages. Choose a number you will remember, type it in, and confirm it by typing it again. Write this PIN down and keep it somewhere safe.

### Step 4: Record your personal greeting

After setting the PIN, you will be asked to record a greeting. This is the message callers hear when they reach your voicemail. Tap **Custom** or **Personal** to record your own greeting. Speak clearly and say something like: "Hello, you have reached [your name]. I am not available right now. Please leave a message after the tone and I will call you back." Tap **Save** or **Done** when finished.

### Step 5: Listen to a voicemail message

When someone leaves you a voicemail, you will see a notification on your phone. On **iPhone**, tap the **Voicemail** tab in the Phone app. You will see a list of messages with the caller's name or number and the time they called. Tap a message, then tap the **play button** to listen.

On **Android**, you can usually call your voicemail by pressing and holding the number **1** on the phone keypad, or by tapping the voicemail notification. Follow the voice prompts to listen.

### Step 6: Delete old voicemail messages

To keep your voicemail inbox tidy, delete messages you no longer need. On **iPhone**, swipe left on a voicemail message and tap **Delete**. On **Android**, after listening to a message, follow the voice prompt to delete it (usually by pressing a number key like **7**). Regularly clearing old messages ensures new callers can always leave you a message.

## Tips

- Record your greeting in a quiet room so callers can hear you clearly.
- If you forget your voicemail PIN, contact your mobile carrier. They can reset it for you.
- On iPhone, voicemail messages are stored on your phone. If you switch phones, you may lose saved voicemails unless they are backed up.
- Some carriers offer visual voicemail, which shows your messages as a list you can tap. Ask your carrier if this is available on your plan.
