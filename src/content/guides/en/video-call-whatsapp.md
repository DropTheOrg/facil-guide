## The steps

### Step 1: Open WhatsApp

Find the green **WhatsApp** icon on your home screen and **tap on it** to open the app.

### Step 2: Find the contact

In your conversation list, **find the person** you want to video call. Tap on their name to open the conversation. If you do not see them, tap the **"New chat"** button in the top right corner and search for their name.

### Step 3: Tap the video call button

At the top right of the conversation screen, you will see a **video camera icon**. **Tap on it** to start the video call.

### Step 4: Wait for the person to answer

Your phone will ring while waiting for the other person to pick up. You will see yourself on the screen from your front camera. When they answer, you will see their face on the full screen.

### Step 5: End the call

When you are finished talking, tap the **red button** at the bottom of the screen to hang up.

## Helpful tips

- **Switch camera**: During the call, tap the **camera flip icon** to switch between the front and back camera. This is useful if you want to show something around you.
- **Mute yourself**: Tap the **microphone icon** during the call if you need to mute your sound temporarily.
- **Use Wi-Fi**: Video calls use more data than regular calls. Connect to Wi-Fi whenever possible to avoid using your mobile data.
- **Good lighting**: Position yourself facing a window or light source so the other person can see you clearly.
