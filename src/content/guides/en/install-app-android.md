## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to find and install an app on your Android phone. Apps let you do many things like send messages, check the weather, play games, and much more.

## What you need

- An Android phone
- An Internet connection (Wi-Fi is recommended)
- A Google account (your Gmail account)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Google Play Store

Find the **Play Store** icon on your home screen. It looks like a colorful triangle pointing to the right. **Tap on it** to open it.

### Step 2: Search for the app

At the top of the screen, you will see a **search bar**. Tap on it and type the name of the app you want to install. For example, type "WhatsApp" or "weather". Then tap the **magnifying glass** icon or press **Enter** on your keyboard.

### Step 3: Choose the right app

A list of apps will appear. Look for the one you want. Check the app name, the developer name below it, and the star rating. Tap on the app to see more details.

### Step 4: Tap Install

On the app's page, tap the green **"Install"** button. If the app costs money, the button will show the price instead. For free apps, it will simply say **Install**.

### Step 5: Wait for the download

The app will begin downloading and installing. You will see a progress bar. This usually takes less than a minute on Wi-Fi. Do not close the Play Store while it is downloading.

### Step 6: Open the app

Once installed, the button will change to **"Open"**. Tap it to start using the app. You will also find the app icon on your home screen for future use.

## Helpful tips

- **Updates**: Apps update regularly. To keep them working well, open the Play Store, tap your profile picture, and tap **"Manage apps and device"** to update all apps.
- **Storage**: If your phone says there is not enough space, you may need to delete old photos or unused apps before installing a new one.
- **Only use the Play Store**: Avoid installing apps from unknown websites. The Play Store checks apps for safety before making them available.
