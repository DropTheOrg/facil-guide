  - question: "What should I do if I already clicked a suspicious link?"
    answer: "Do not enter any personal information. Close the page immediately. If you entered a password, change it right away on the real website. If you entered banking details, call your bank immediately. Run a security scan on your phone if you have an antivirus app."
  - question: "Can scammers use my phone number?"
    answer: "Scammers can send messages to any phone number. Receiving a scam message does not mean your phone is compromised. Simply delete the message and do not reply."
  - question: "Why do scam messages look so real?"
    answer: "Scammers copy the logos, colors, and language of real companies to trick you. They invest time making their messages look authentic. That is why you should always verify through official channels instead of trusting the message itself."
  - question: "Should I report scam messages?"
    answer: "Yes. On iPhone, you can report spam text messages by tapping Report Junk below the message. On Android, tap and hold the message, then tap Report spam. You can also forward suspicious texts to 7726 (SPAM) in many countries."
  - question: "Are scams only sent by text and email?"
    answer: "No. Scams can come through text messages, emails, phone calls, WhatsApp messages, social media messages, and even paper mail. The warning signs are similar regardless of how the message arrives."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to recognize the most common types of scam messages, phishing emails, and fraudulent phone calls. You will know exactly what warning signs to look for so you never fall for a scam.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- A healthy dose of suspicion when something feels wrong

## The steps

### Step 1: Check if the message creates urgency or fear

The biggest warning sign of a scam is urgency. Scam messages often say things like "Your account will be closed in 24 hours," "You have an unpaid fine," or "Someone tried to access your account." Real companies rarely send urgent threats by text message. If a message makes you feel panicked, stop and think before doing anything.

### Step 2: Look at who sent the message

Check the sender's email address or phone number carefully. Scam emails often come from addresses that look almost right but are slightly wrong, like "support@amaz0n-security.com" instead of "support@amazon.com." On text messages, scammers sometimes use short codes or unfamiliar numbers. If you do not recognize the sender, be suspicious.

### Step 3: Look for spelling and grammar mistakes

Many scam messages contain spelling errors, odd grammar, or awkward phrasing. While some scams are well-written, poor language quality is still a common warning sign. A real message from your bank or a government agency will usually be professionally written.

### Step 4: Do not click links in the message

Scam messages almost always include a link they want you to click. **Do not tap the link.** Instead, if the message claims to be from your bank or a company you use, open the real app or type the real website address into your browser yourself. If there is a real problem, you will see it when you log in through the official channel.

### Step 5: Never share personal information by text or email

No real bank, government agency, or company will ask for your password, PIN code, credit card number, or social security number by text message or email. If a message asks for this information, it is a scam. Always. No exceptions.

### Step 6: Verify by contacting the company directly

If you are unsure whether a message is real, contact the company yourself using the phone number on their official website or on the back of your bank card. Do not use the phone number in the suspicious message. Explain what you received and ask if it is real.

### Step 7: Delete the message and block the sender

Once you have determined the message is a scam, delete it. On iPhone, swipe left on the message and tap **Delete**. On Android, tap and hold the message and tap **Delete**. Then block the sender so they cannot message you again. On iPhone, tap the sender's number, then tap **Info**, then **Block this Caller**. On Android, tap the three dots and tap **Block**.

## Tips

- When in doubt, do nothing. A real message can wait. A scam message wants you to act immediately.
- Your bank will never ask you to transfer money to a "safe account." This is always a scam.
- If someone calls claiming to be from your bank or the police, hang up and call the official number yourself.
- Tell your family members about common scams, especially elderly relatives who may be more vulnerable.
- Remember: if something sounds too good to be true (like winning a prize you never entered), it is a scam.
