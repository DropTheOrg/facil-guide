    answer: "No. Most mobile carriers include Wi-Fi calling at no extra charge. Calls made over Wi-Fi use your normal minutes, the same as regular calls. Check with your carrier if you are unsure."
  - question: "Does Wi-Fi calling use my internet data?"
    answer: "Wi-Fi calling uses your Wi-Fi connection, not your mobile data. If you are connected to a home or office Wi-Fi network, there is no data charge. However, if you use a mobile hotspot, it would use that data."

    answer: "No. The person you call will see your normal phone number. They will not know the difference between a Wi-Fi call and a regular call."
  - question: "Can I use Wi-Fi calling abroad?"
    answer: "In many cases, yes. Wi-Fi calling can help you avoid roaming charges when traveling. However, some carriers restrict Wi-Fi calling outside your home country. Check with your carrier before traveling."
  - question: "What happens if I leave my Wi-Fi network during a call?"
    answer: "Most modern phones will switch the call to your mobile network automatically without dropping the call. You may hear a brief pause, but the call usually continues."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to turn on Wi-Fi calling on your iPhone or Android phone. Wi-Fi calling lets you make and receive phone calls over a Wi-Fi network instead of using your mobile signal. This is very helpful when you are in a building where the mobile signal is weak but you have a good Wi-Fi connection.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone that supports Wi-Fi calling (most phones made after 2018 do)
- A Wi-Fi network you are connected to
- A mobile carrier that supports Wi-Fi calling (most major carriers do)

### Step 1: Check if your carrier supports Wi-Fi calling

Most large mobile carriers support Wi-Fi calling, but it is good to check first. You can call your carrier's customer service number or visit their website. If you are unsure, simply try to turn it on in the next steps. If the option does not appear, your carrier or phone may not support it.

### Step 2: Connect to a Wi-Fi network

Make sure your phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network. Open **Settings** on your phone and tap **Wi-Fi**. Choose your network from the list and enter the password if needed. You should see the Wi-Fi symbol at the top of your screen when connected.

### Step 3: Turn on Wi-Fi calling on iPhone

If you have an iPhone:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Phone**
3. Tap **Wi-Fi Calling**
4. Turn on the switch next to **Wi-Fi Calling on This iPhone**
5. You may be asked to confirm your emergency address. Enter your home address and tap **Save**

When Wi-Fi calling is active, you will see the word **Wi-Fi** next to your carrier name in the status bar at the top of your screen.

### Step 4: Turn on Wi-Fi calling on Android

If you have an Android phone:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Network and internet** or **Connections** (the name varies by phone brand)
3. Tap **Wi-Fi Calling** or look for it under **Mobile network**
4. Turn on the switch to enable Wi-Fi calling
5. You may be asked to agree to terms or confirm your emergency address

On Samsung phones, go to **Settings**, then **Connections**, then **Wi-Fi Calling**. On Google Pixel phones, go to **Settings**, then **Network and internet**, then **Calls and SMS**, then **Wi-Fi calling**.

### Step 5: Test Wi-Fi calling

To check that it is working, turn on airplane mode first (this turns off your mobile signal), then turn Wi-Fi back on. Now try making a phone call. If the call goes through, Wi-Fi calling is working correctly. After testing, you can turn airplane mode off again.

### Step 6: Set your Wi-Fi calling preference

You can choose whether your phone should prefer Wi-Fi or your mobile network for calls.

- **On iPhone:** Go to **Settings**, then **Phone**, then **Wi-Fi Calling**. If you see a **Wi-Fi Calling preference** option, you can choose between Wi-Fi preferred or mobile preferred.
- **On Android:** Go to the Wi-Fi calling settings (same path as Step 4). Look for a preference option. Choose **Wi-Fi preferred** if your mobile signal is usually weak at home, or **Mobile preferred** if you only want to use Wi-Fi calling as a backup.

## Tips

- Wi-Fi calling is especially useful in basements, thick-walled buildings, or rural areas where mobile signal is weak.
- If you have poor Wi-Fi quality (slow or unstable), your call quality may also be poor. A stable Wi-Fi connection works best.
- You do not need to do anything special to receive calls over Wi-Fi. Once enabled, incoming calls will use Wi-Fi automatically when your mobile signal is weak.
- If you experience echo or delay during Wi-Fi calls, try moving closer to your Wi-Fi router.
