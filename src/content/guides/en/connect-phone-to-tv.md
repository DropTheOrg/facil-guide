faq:
  - question: "Do I need a smart TV for this?"
    answer: "Screen mirroring works best with a smart TV. If your TV is not a smart TV, you can buy a streaming device like Apple TV, Chromecast, or Amazon Fire TV Stick and plug it into your TV."
  - question: "Do my phone and TV need to be on the same Wi-Fi?"
    answer: "Yes. Your phone and your TV (or streaming device) must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for screen mirroring to work."
  - question: "Why is there a delay between my phone and the TV?"
    answer: "A small delay is normal. Screen mirroring sends the image over Wi-Fi, which takes a fraction of a second. If the delay is very long, move closer to your Wi-Fi router or restart both devices."
  - question: "Can I use my phone while it is mirroring?"
    answer: "Yes, but everything you do on your phone will show on the TV. If you open a private message, the people watching the TV will see it too."
  - question: "Does screen mirroring use a lot of battery?"
    answer: "Yes, more than normal use. If you plan to mirror for a long time, keep your phone plugged in to a charger."

## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- A smart TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, or Amazon Fire TV Stick
- Both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network

## Step 1: Make Sure Both Devices Are on the Same Wi-Fi

Your phone and TV must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

- Check your phone's Wi-Fi in **Settings** > **Wi-Fi**
- Check your TV's Wi-Fi in the TV's **Settings** menu (usually under **Network**)

If they are on different networks, change one to match the other.

## Step 2: Open the Mirroring Feature on Your Phone

- **On iPhone:** Swipe down from the top-right corner (or up from the bottom on older iPhones) to open **Control Center**. Tap the **Screen Mirroring** button (two overlapping rectangles)
- **On Android:** Swipe down from the top with two fingers. Look for **Smart View**, **Cast**, **Screen Cast**, or **Wireless Display** and tap it

## Step 3: Select Your TV

A list of available devices will appear on your phone. Tap the name of your TV.

If you do not see your TV in the list:

- Make sure the TV is turned on
- Check that both are on the same Wi-Fi
- Restart both devices and try again

## Step 4: Confirm the Connection

Some TVs will show a code on the screen and ask you to confirm on your phone. If you see a code:

- Check that the code on your phone matches the code on the TV
- Tap **Allow** or **OK** on your phone

Your phone screen will now appear on the TV.

## Step 5: Enjoy and Disconnect When Done

Your TV now shows everything on your phone screen. You can:

- Show photos and videos to family
- Watch YouTube or streaming apps on the big screen
- Share a video call on the TV

**To disconnect:**
- **On iPhone:** Open Control Center, tap Screen Mirroring, tap **Stop Mirroring**
- **On Android:** Open Quick Settings, tap Cast or Smart View, tap **Disconnect**

## You Did It!

You can now share your phone screen with your TV. This is a great way to show photos, watch videos together, or video call on a bigger screen.
