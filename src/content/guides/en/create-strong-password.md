faq:
  - question: "How long should a strong password be?"
    answer: "A strong password should be at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are harder to crack. Aim for 14 characters or more for important accounts."
  - question: "Should I use the same password for everything?"
    answer: "No. Never use the same password for multiple accounts. If one account is hacked, all your other accounts would be at risk."
  - question: "How often should I change my passwords?"
    answer: "Change a password immediately if you think an account has been compromised. Otherwise, updating important passwords once a year is a good habit."
  - question: "What is two-factor authentication?"
    answer: "Two-factor authentication adds an extra security step when you log in. After entering your password, you also enter a code sent to your phone. This means a hacker would need both your password and your phone to access your account."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to create passwords that are strong and hard to guess. A good password protects your email, banking, social media, and other online accounts from being accessed by strangers.

## What you need

- A device with Internet access (phone, tablet, or computer)
- A way to store passwords safely (paper notebook or password manager app)

## The steps

### Step 1: Understand what makes a password weak

Weak passwords are easy for hackers to guess. Avoid these common mistakes:
- Your name, birthday, or phone number
- Simple words like "password" or "123456"
- Keyboard patterns like "qwerty" or "abcdef"
- The same password used on multiple websites

### Step 2: Choose a password method

One good method is to think of a sentence that is easy for you to remember and use the first letters plus numbers and symbols. For example, the sentence "I walk my dog Benny every morning at 7" becomes: **IwmdBem@7**

Another method is to string together three or four random words: **purple-kitchen-river-44**

### Step 3: Make it at least 12 characters long

Count the characters in your password. It should have at least 12. Each extra character makes it much harder to crack. If your password is too short, add more words, numbers, or symbols.

### Step 4: Mix different types of characters

A strong password uses a mix of:
- **Uppercase letters**: A, B, C
- **Lowercase letters**: a, b, c
- **Numbers**: 0, 1, 2, 3
- **Symbols**: !, @, #, $, -, _

For example: **River-Table-22-Moon!**

### Step 5: Test your password

Before using your new password, check that it:
- Is at least 12 characters long
- Contains uppercase and lowercase letters
- Contains at least one number
- Contains at least one symbol
- Does not include your name or birthday
- Is not the same as any other password you use

### Step 6: Store your password safely

Write your password on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place at home (not next to your computer). Or use a **password manager** app like iCloud Keychain (built into iPhone), which stores all your passwords securely. To enable it, go to **Settings**, tap your name, then **iCloud**, then **Passwords and Keychain**, and turn it on.

## Helpful tips

- **Use a password manager**: Apps like iCloud Keychain or 1Password create and remember strong passwords for you. You only need to remember one master password.
- **Turn on two-factor authentication**: For your most important accounts (email, banking), enable two-factor authentication. This sends a code to your phone when someone tries to log in.
- **Never share passwords**: No legitimate company will ever ask for your password by email or phone. If someone asks, it is a scam.
- **Check for breaches**: If a website you use announces a security breach, change your password for that site immediately.
