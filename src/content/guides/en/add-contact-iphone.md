## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to add a new contact to your iPhone. Saving someone as a contact means you can quickly find their number to call or send a message without typing it every time.

## What you need

- An iPhone (any model)
- The phone number or email address you want to save

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Contacts app

Find the **Contacts** app on your home screen. It has an icon that looks like a person's silhouette on a grey background. Tap on it to open it.

### Step 2: Tap the plus button

In the top right corner of the screen, you will see a **+** (plus) button. Tap on it. This opens a blank form where you can enter the new contact's information.

### Step 3: Enter the person's name

Tap the **First name** field and type the person's first name using the keyboard. Then tap the **Last name** field and type their last name. You do not need to fill in both, but it makes the contact easier to find later.

### Step 4: Add their phone number

Tap the field that says **add phone**. Type the person's phone number using the number keyboard that appears. If you need to add a country code, include it at the beginning (for example, +1 for the United States or +44 for the United Kingdom).

### Step 5: Tap Done to save

When you have entered all the information, tap **Done** in the top right corner of the screen. The contact is now saved and will appear in your Contacts list.

## Helpful tips

- **Add more details**: You can also add an email address, home address, or birthday in the same form. Just tap the relevant field.
- **Favorites**: To add someone to your favorites for quick access, open their contact and tap **Add to Favorites**.
- **Duplicates**: If you accidentally save the same person twice, go to their contact, scroll down, and look for the option to merge duplicate contacts.
