  - question: "Is Facebook free?"
    answer: "Yes, Facebook is completely free to use. You do not need to pay anything to create an account, post updates, or message friends. Facebook makes money from adverts that appear in your feed, but you do not need to click on them."
  - question: "Who can see what I post on Facebook?"
    answer: "You control who sees your posts. When you write a post, you can choose Friends (only people you have added as friends), Public (anyone), or Only Me (just you). You can change this setting for each post."
  - question: "How do I add a friend on Facebook?"
    answer: "Search for the person's name using the search bar at the top of the app. When you find their profile, tap the Add Friend button. They will receive a friend request and need to accept it before you are connected."
  - question: "Can I delete something I posted?"
    answer: "Yes. Find the post you want to remove, tap the three dots in the top right corner of the post, and tap Delete Post. Once deleted, it will be removed from your profile and other people's feeds."
  - question: "How do I stop someone from contacting me?"
    answer: "You can block a person so they cannot see your profile, send you messages, or interact with your posts. Go to their profile, tap the three dots, and choose Block. They will not be notified that you blocked them."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use Facebook on your phone to stay connected with family and friends. You will learn how to read updates from people you know, share photos, write posts, and send private messages. Facebook is one of the most popular social networks in the world and a great way to keep in touch with loved ones.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- The Facebook app (free from the App Store or Google Play Store)
- An email address or mobile phone number to create an account
- An internet connection

## The steps

### Step 1: Download and open Facebook

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android) and search for **Facebook**. Tap **Install** or **Get** to download the app. Once installed, tap the **Facebook** icon on your home screen to open it. It is a white letter "f" on a blue background.

### Step 2: Create an account or log in

If you already have a Facebook account, enter your email address (or phone number) and password, then tap **Log In**. If you are new to Facebook, tap **Create New Account** and follow the steps. You will need to enter your name, date of birth, email address or phone number, and choose a password.

### Step 3: Read your news feed

After logging in, you will see your **News Feed**. This is the main screen that shows posts from your friends and pages you follow. Scroll down by swiping up with your finger to see more posts. You will see text updates, photos, videos, and shared articles from people you know.

### Step 4: Write a post

To share something with your friends, tap the box at the top of the News Feed that says **What's on your mind?**. Type your message. You can also add a photo by tapping the **Photo** icon (a small image of mountains or a camera). When your post is ready, tap **Post** in the top right corner to share it.

### Step 5: Share a photo

To share a photo, tap **What's on your mind?** at the top of the News Feed, then tap the **Photo/Video** button. Your phone will show your photo library. Tap the photo (or photos) you want to share. You can add a caption describing the photo. Tap **Post** to share it with your friends.

### Step 6: Send a private message

To send a private message that only one person can see, tap the **Messenger** icon at the top of the Facebook app (it looks like a lightning bolt or speech bubble). Tap the name of the person you want to message, type your message, and tap the **send button** (an arrow icon). You may be asked to install the Messenger app separately.

### Step 7: Adjust your privacy settings

To control who can see your information, tap the **three horizontal lines** (menu) in the bottom right corner (iPhone) or top right corner (Android). Scroll down and tap **Settings & Privacy**, then tap **Settings**. Under **Audience and Visibility**, you can choose who sees your posts, friend list, and profile information. Set these to **Friends** if you only want people you know to see your content.

## Tips

- Be careful about accepting friend requests from people you do not know in real life.
- Never share your password, bank details, or personal identification numbers on Facebook.
- You can "like" a friend's post by tapping the thumbs-up icon below it. This lets them know you enjoyed their update.
- If you see a post or message that looks suspicious or like a scam, do not click any links in it. Report it by tapping the three dots and choosing **Report**.
