## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to send a photo to someone on WhatsApp. It is a simple and free way to share your photos with your family and friends.

## What you need

- An iPhone with WhatsApp installed
- An Internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)
- A photo on your phone (or you can take a new one)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open WhatsApp

Look for the green WhatsApp icon on your home screen. It looks like a white phone inside a green circle. **Tap on it once** to open the app.

### Step 2: Choose the contact

In your conversation list, **find the person** you want to send the photo to. Tap on their name to open the conversation.

If you do not see this person, tap the "New chat" button in the top right corner (the icon with a pencil).

### Step 3: Tap the + button

At the bottom left of the screen, you will see a **"+" button**. Tap on it. A menu will appear with several options.

### Step 4: Choose "Photo Library"

In the menu that appears, tap on **"Photo & Video Library"**. This will open your photos.

You can also choose "Camera" if you want to take a new photo.

### Step 5: Select your photo

Browse through your photos and **tap on the one you want to send**. A small blue circle will appear on the selected photo.

You can select multiple photos if you wish.

### Step 6: Send the photo

Tap the **blue button with an arrow** at the bottom right of the screen. Your photo will be sent immediately.

You will see two small checkmarks next to your photo: one grey checkmark means the message was sent, two blue checkmarks mean it has been read.

## Helpful tips

- **Photo quality**: WhatsApp slightly compresses photos to send them faster. The quality remains very good for normal use.
- **Wi-Fi is preferred**: If possible, use Wi-Fi to send photos. This will not use your mobile data.
- **Add a message**: Before sending, you can write a short message under the photo by tapping on the text area.
