## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to connect your iPhone to a Wi-Fi network. Using Wi-Fi gives you a faster internet connection and saves your mobile data.

## What you need

- An iPhone (any model)
- A Wi-Fi network name and password

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Settings

Find the **Settings** app on your home screen. It has an icon that looks like grey gears. Tap on it.

### Step 2: Tap Wi-Fi

Near the top of the Settings screen, you will see **Wi-Fi**. Tap on it. Make sure the toggle next to Wi-Fi is turned on (green). If it is grey, tap it to turn it on.

### Step 3: Choose your network

Your iPhone will show a list of available Wi-Fi networks. Find the name of the network you want to connect to and tap on it. This is often the name of your router or the name given by the place you are in (like a cafe or hotel).

### Step 4: Enter the password

A box will appear asking for the password. Type the Wi-Fi password carefully using the keyboard. Passwords are case-sensitive, which means capital and small letters matter. When you have typed the password, tap **Join** in the top right corner.

### Step 5: Confirm the connection

If the password is correct, a blue checkmark will appear next to the network name. You will also see the Wi-Fi icon (curved lines) in the top right corner of your screen. You are now connected.

## Helpful tips

- **Automatic reconnect**: Your iPhone remembers Wi-Fi networks you have joined before. It will connect automatically next time you are nearby.
- **Forget a network**: If you want to stop your phone from connecting to a network automatically, tap the blue info icon (i) next to the network name, then tap **Forget This Network**.
- **Check your connection**: If the internet seems slow, try turning Wi-Fi off and on again in Settings. This often fixes temporary issues.
