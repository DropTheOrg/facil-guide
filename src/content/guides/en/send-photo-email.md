faq:
  - question: "Is there a limit to how many photos I can send?"
    answer: "Most email services have a size limit of 25 megabytes per email. One photo is usually 2 to 5 megabytes, so you can typically send 5 to 10 photos per email. If you need to send more, split them across multiple emails."
  - question: "Will the photo quality be reduced?"
    answer: "Some email apps ask if you want to send the photo in its original size or a smaller size. Choose original size for the best quality, or a smaller size if the person only needs to view it on screen."
  - question: "Can I send a video the same way?"
    answer: "Yes, but videos are much larger than photos. If the video is too big for email, the phone may offer to send a link instead (like an iCloud link on iPhone or a Google Drive link on Android)."
  - question: "What if the person says they did not receive my email?"
    answer: "Check your Sent folder to confirm the email was sent. Large attachments sometimes get blocked by the recipient's email provider. Ask them to check their spam folder. If the photos were too large, try resending with a smaller size."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to send a photo from your phone as an email attachment. This is useful when someone needs a high-quality copy of a photo, or when you want to send pictures to someone who does not use WhatsApp or other messaging apps.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- An email account set up on your phone (Gmail, Outlook, or the built-in Mail app)
- The email address of the person you want to send the photo to

## The steps

### Step 1: Open your email app

Find your email app and tap it to open. On iPhone, you can use **Mail** (the blue envelope icon) or **Gmail**. On Android, you can use **Gmail** (the colorful M icon) or your phone's built-in email app.

### Step 2: Start a new email

Tap the **compose** button to create a new email. It looks like a **pencil icon** or a **plus icon** depending on your app. On Gmail, it is a colorful pencil icon in the bottom right corner. On iPhone Mail, it is a square with a pencil in the bottom right.

### Step 3: Fill in the recipient and subject

Tap the **To** field and type the email address of the person you want to send the photo to. Tap the **Subject** field and type a short description like "Photos from Saturday" or "Photo you asked for."

### Step 4: Attach the photo

To add a photo to your email, tap the **attachment icon** (it looks like a paperclip) in the toolbar. Then tap **Photo Library** or **Attach File** and browse your photos. Tap the photo you want to attach. You can select multiple photos by tapping several. On iPhone Mail, you can also tap inside the email body, then tap the **arrow icon** above the keyboard and choose **Insert Photo or Video**.

### Step 5: Check the attachment

After selecting the photo, you should see it appear in your email as a small preview image or as a file name with a size indicator. Make sure the right photo is attached before sending.

### Step 6: Send the email

Tap the **send button** (it looks like a paper airplane or an arrow pointing up). Your email with the photo attached will be sent. If the photo is large, it may take a moment to upload. Do not close the app until you see a confirmation or the email moves to your Sent folder.

## Tips

- If you want to send many photos at once, consider creating a shared album in Google Photos or iCloud Photos and sending the link by email instead.
- Write a short message in the email body so the person knows what the photos are about.
- If the email app asks about photo size, choose **Medium** or **Actual Size** depending on how important the quality is.
- You can also send a photo directly from the Photos app by tapping the **share icon** and choosing **Mail** or **Gmail**.
