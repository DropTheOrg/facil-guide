## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up emergency contacts and Medical ID on your phone. If something happens to you, first responders can access this information from your lock screen to contact your family and learn about your medical needs.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- The phone numbers of the people you want as emergency contacts
- Your basic medical information (optional but recommended)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open the Health app on iPhone

On iPhone, open the **Health** app (it has a white icon with a red heart). If this is your first time opening it, you may need to tap **Get Started** and follow a few setup screens.

### Step 2: Set up Medical ID on iPhone

Tap your **profile picture** in the top right corner, then tap **Medical ID**. Tap **Edit**. Fill in your medical conditions, allergies, medications, and blood type. Scroll down to **Emergency Contacts** and tap **Add Emergency Contact**. Choose a contact from your phone and select their relationship to you (spouse, parent, child, friend). Tap **Done** when finished.

### Step 3: Enable lock screen access on iPhone

While editing your Medical ID, make sure the toggle for **Show When Locked** is turned on. This allows first responders to see your medical information and emergency contacts from the lock screen by tapping **Emergency** then **Medical ID**.

### Step 4: Set up emergency contacts on Android

On Android, open **Settings** and tap **Safety and emergency** (or **Emergency** on some phones). Tap **Emergency contacts** and add the people you want. Choose contacts from your phone book. On Samsung phones, go to **Settings**, then **Safety and emergency**, then **Medical info**.

### Step 5: Add medical information on Android

In the same **Safety and emergency** section, tap **Medical information** (or **Medical info**). Enter your name, blood type, allergies, medications, and any medical conditions. This information will be visible from the lock screen during an emergency.

### Step 6: Test that it works from the lock screen

Lock your phone. On the lock screen, tap **Emergency** (or **Emergency call**). You should see an option for **Medical ID** (iPhone) or **Emergency information** (Android). Tap it to make sure your information and contacts appear correctly.

### Step 7: Set up Emergency SOS

On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **Emergency SOS**. Make sure **Call with Hold and Release** or **Call with 5 Button Presses** is enabled. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **Safety and emergency**, then **Emergency SOS**. This feature lets you quickly call emergency services by pressing the power button multiple times.

## Tips

- Update your Medical ID whenever your medications or medical conditions change.
- Tell your emergency contacts that they are listed on your phone so they know to expect a call if something happens.
- Add at least two emergency contacts in case one person is unreachable.
- If you take medications regularly, include the names and dosages in your Medical ID.
