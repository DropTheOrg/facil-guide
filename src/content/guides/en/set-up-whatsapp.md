  - question: "Do I need a phone number?"
    answer: "Yes. WhatsApp requires a phone number to create your account. This is how other people find you on WhatsApp."
  - question: "Can I use WhatsApp on a tablet?"
    answer: "On Android tablets with a SIM card, yes. On iPads, WhatsApp is not officially available, but you can use WhatsApp Web in Safari by going to web.whatsapp.com."
  - question: "What happens to my old messages if I change phones?"
    answer: "If you backed up your chats (the app asks you during setup), your messages will be restored on your new phone. iPhone backups use iCloud, Android uses Google Drive."
  - question: "Can I use WhatsApp without internet?"
    answer: "No. WhatsApp needs an internet connection to send and receive messages. Without Wi-Fi or mobile data, messages will be sent when you reconnect."

This confirms that the phone number belongs to you.

You will be asked to:

1. **Add your name** -- type your first name (this is what people see when you message them)

Tap **Done** or **Next**.

WhatsApp will scan your phone contacts and show you who already has WhatsApp.

To send your first message:

1. Tap the **pencil icon** (iPhone) or **chat bubble** (Android) to start a new chat
2. Select a contact from the list
3. Type your message and tap **Send** (arrow icon)
