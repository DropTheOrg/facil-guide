## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to add your email account to the Mail app on your iPhone. This lets you read and send emails directly from your phone without opening a web browser.

## What you need

- An iPhone (any model)
- Your email address and password

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Settings

Find the **Settings** app on your home screen. It has an icon that looks like grey gears. Tap on it.

### Step 2: Tap Mail

Scroll down and tap **Mail**. Then tap **Accounts** at the top of the Mail settings screen.

### Step 3: Tap Add Account

Tap **Add Account**. You will see a list of email providers: **iCloud**, **Microsoft Exchange**, **Google**, **Yahoo**, **Aol**, and **Other**.

### Step 4: Choose your email provider

Tap the name of your email provider. For example:
- If your email ends in **@gmail.com**, tap **Google**.
- If your email ends in **@outlook.com** or **@hotmail.com**, tap **Microsoft Exchange** or **Outlook.com**.
- If your email ends in **@yahoo.com**, tap **Yahoo**.
- If your provider is not listed, tap **Other**, then tap **Add Mail Account**.

### Step 5: Sign in to your email

Enter your **email address** and **password** when asked. If your provider uses a web sign-in page (like Google), you will be taken to that page to enter your details. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### Step 6: Choose what to sync and tap Save

After signing in, you will see toggles for **Mail**, **Contacts**, **Calendars**, and **Notes**. Make sure **Mail** is turned on (green). Turn on any other options you want. Then tap **Save** in the top right corner.

## Helpful tips

- **Check the Mail app**: After setup, open the **Mail** app (the blue icon with a white envelope) to see your inbox. Pull down on the inbox screen to refresh and check for new messages.
- **Default account**: If you have multiple accounts, go to Settings, Mail, then Default Account to choose which one is used when you write a new email.
- **Spam folder**: If you are missing emails, check the **Junk** folder in the Mail app. Sometimes important emails end up there by mistake.
