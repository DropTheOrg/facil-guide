## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to set up the IO app on your phone and use it to access Italian government services. IO lets you receive messages from public administrations, pay taxes and fees, access the Carta Giovani Nazionale, and manage government bonuses. It is the single official app for interacting with Italian public services digitally.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone
- A SPID digital identity or a CIE (Carta di Identità Elettronica) with its PIN
- An internet connection

## The steps

### Step 1: Download the IO app

Open the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android) and search for **IO**. The app icon is a white circle with a blue background. Tap **Install** or **Get** to download it.

### Step 2: Open the app and start login

Open the **IO** app. On the welcome screen, tap **Log in with SPID** or **Log in with CIE**. If you choose SPID, select your SPID provider from the list (for example **PosteID**, **Aruba**, or **Infocert**). If you choose CIE, you will need your CIE card and its PIN.

### Step 3: Complete the login

If you selected SPID, enter your SPID username and password on the provider's login page. Approve the login on your SPID provider's app if requested. If you selected CIE, enter the first 4 digits of your CIE PIN, then hold your CIE card against the back of your phone for the NFC reader to scan it, then enter the remaining 4 digits.

### Step 4: Set up your security code

After logging in for the first time, IO will ask you to create a **6-digit unlock code**. Choose a code you can remember. You can also enable **Face ID** or **fingerprint** to unlock the app more easily in the future.

### Step 5: Explore your messages

Tap the **Messages** tab at the bottom of the screen. Here you will see official communications from government agencies, such as payment reminders, appointment confirmations, or bonus notifications. Tap any message to read its details.

### Step 6: Make a payment

When you receive a payment notice in your messages (for example, a tax payment or a fine), tap the message and then tap **Pay**. The app uses the **pagoPA** system. Choose your payment method: credit card, debit card, PayPal, or bank transfer. Follow the instructions to complete the payment. You will receive a receipt in the app.

### Step 7: Access your services and bonuses

Tap the **Services** tab to see which government services are available to you. You can activate or deactivate notifications for each service. If you are eligible for bonuses (like the Bonus Cultura or Carta Giovani), they will appear in the **Wallet** tab where you can activate and use them.

## Tips

- Keep push notifications turned on for the IO app so you do not miss important messages from the government.
- You can add a payment card to the app's wallet once and use it for all future payments without entering the details again.
- If your SPID login fails, make sure your SPID provider app is up to date and that you have approved the login notification.
- Check the Services tab regularly because new local and national services are added frequently.
