faq:
  - question: "Will sending a photo cost me money?"
    answer: "If you send a photo as an MMS (multimedia message), it may cost a small amount depending on your phone plan. If you send it through iMessage (iPhone to iPhone) or over Wi-Fi, it is usually free. Check your phone plan if you are unsure."
  - question: "Why is my photo blurry when I send it?"
    answer: "Text messages (MMS) compress photos to make them smaller. The photo may lose some quality. For higher quality, send photos through WhatsApp, email, or iMessage instead."
  - question: "Can I send more than one photo at a time?"
    answer: "Yes. In most messaging apps, you can tap the photo icon and select multiple photos before sending. On iPhone, tap each photo you want to include, then press send."
  - question: "What if the person says they did not receive my photo?"
    answer: "The photo may be too large for their phone to download, or their phone plan may not support MMS. Try sending it through WhatsApp or email instead."

## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- A photo already saved on your phone
- The phone number of the person you want to send it to

## Step 1: Open Your Messages App

Tap the **Messages** app on your home screen.

- **On iPhone:** It is the green icon with a white speech bubble
- **On Android:** It is usually called **Messages** with a blue or purple chat bubble icon

## Step 2: Start a New Message or Open an Existing Conversation

You can either:

- **Open an existing conversation:** Tap the name of the person you want to send the photo to
- **Start a new message:** Tap the **compose** button (pencil icon or "+" icon) and type the person's name or phone number

## Step 3: Tap the Photo or Camera Icon

Look for the icon to attach a photo:

- **On iPhone:** Tap the **+** button next to the text box, then tap **Photos**
- **On Android:** Tap the **paperclip** icon or the **photo** icon (small image icon) next to the text box

This will open your photo gallery.

## Step 4: Select Your Photo

Browse your photos and tap the one you want to send. A blue checkmark will appear on it.

If you want to take a new photo instead, tap the **camera** option to open your camera, take the photo, and it will be attached automatically.

## Step 5: Send the Message

Once the photo is attached, you will see a preview of it in the message box.

- Tap the **Send** button (arrow icon)
- Wait a moment for the photo to upload and send

You will see a progress bar or a "Delivered" confirmation when it is sent.

## You Did It!

You sent a photo by text message. The other person will see it in their messages along with any text you added.
