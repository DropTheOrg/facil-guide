On your computer, open a web browser and go to **web.whatsapp.com**. You will see a large QR code (a square pattern of black and white dots) on the screen.

### Step 2: Open WhatsApp on your phone

On your phone, open the **WhatsApp** app.

### Step 3: Open the linked devices menu

**On iPhone:** Tap **Settings** in the bottom right corner, then tap **Linked Devices**.

### Step 4: Tap Link a Device

Tap **Link a Device**. Your phone may ask you to confirm with your fingerprint, face, or passcode.

Point your phone's camera at the QR code on your computer screen. Hold it steady. Your phone will automatically read the code and connect.

### Step 6: Start using WhatsApp on your computer

After a few seconds, all your WhatsApp conversations will appear on your computer screen. You can now read and send messages using your keyboard.

## Helpful tips
