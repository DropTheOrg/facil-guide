  - question: "Will I lose my data if I delete an app?"

    answer: "Yes. Open the App Store, search for the app, and tap the download button. If you paid for it, you will not be charged again."
  - question: "What is the difference between Remove App and Delete App?"

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to delete apps from your iPhone. Removing apps you no longer use frees up storage space and keeps your home screen tidy.

## What you need

- An iPhone

## The steps

### Step 1: Find the app you want to delete

Look at your home screen and find the app you want to remove. If you have many apps, swipe left through your home screen pages or swipe down and use the **search bar** to find it.

### Step 2: Press and hold the app icon

Place your finger on the app icon and **hold it down** for about two seconds. Do not press too hard. A small menu will appear on the screen.

### Step 3: Tap Remove App

In the menu that appears, tap **"Remove App"**. This will give you options for what to do with the app.

### Step 4: Tap Delete App

A new menu will appear asking if you want to remove the app from your home screen or delete it entirely. Tap **"Delete App"** to remove it completely from your iPhone and free up the storage space it was using.

### Step 5: Confirm the deletion

A confirmation message will appear asking if you are sure. Tap **"Delete"** to confirm. The app will be removed from your iPhone. The icon will disappear from your home screen.

## Helpful tips

- **Check storage first**: Go to **Settings** then **General** then **iPhone Storage** to see which apps take up the most space. Delete the biggest ones first.
- **Offload unused apps**: In the same storage settings, you can turn on **"Offload Unused Apps"** which automatically removes apps you rarely use while keeping their data.
- **Rearrange apps**: If you just want to move apps around without deleting them, press and hold any app, then tap **"Edit Home Screen"**. You can then drag apps to new positions.
- **App Library**: Swipe to the last page of your home screen to find the **App Library**, which shows all your installed apps organized by category.
