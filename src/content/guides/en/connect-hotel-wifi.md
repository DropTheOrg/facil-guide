  - question: "Is public Wi-Fi safe to use?"
    answer: "Public Wi-Fi is convenient but less secure than your home network. Avoid entering passwords, banking information, or credit card numbers while on public Wi-Fi. If you need to do something sensitive, use your mobile data instead."
  - question: "What is a captive portal?"
    answer: "A captive portal is a login page that appears when you connect to certain Wi-Fi networks. It may ask you to accept terms, enter a room number, or create an account before you can use the internet. It is normal and expected at hotels and airports."
  - question: "Why does the login page not appear?"
    answer: "Sometimes the login page takes a moment to load. Try opening your web browser and visiting any website. If the page still does not appear, try disconnecting from the Wi-Fi and reconnecting. You can also try typing 192.168.1.1 or captive.apple.com in your browser."
  - question: "Do I need to pay for hotel Wi-Fi?"
    answer: "Many hotels offer free Wi-Fi, but some charge a daily fee. Ask at the front desk. The password is often printed on a card in your room or given at check-in."
  - question: "Why is the Wi-Fi so slow?"
    answer: "Public Wi-Fi is shared among many people. During busy times, it can be slow. If you need faster internet for video calls or streaming, use your mobile data or ask if the hotel has a premium Wi-Fi option."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to connect your phone to Wi-Fi networks at hotels, cafes, airports, and other public places. You will also learn how to handle login pages that sometimes appear before you can use the internet.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- The Wi-Fi network name and password (ask at the front desk, check your room key card, or look for signs)

## The steps

### Step 1: Open your Wi-Fi settings

On iPhone, open **Settings** and tap **Wi-Fi**. Make sure the Wi-Fi switch at the top is turned on (it should be green). On Android, open **Settings** and tap **Network and internet** (or **Connections**), then tap **Wi-Fi** and make sure it is turned on.

### Step 2: Find the network and connect

You will see a list of available Wi-Fi networks. Look for the name of the hotel, cafe, or airport network. It is often the name of the place, like "Hilton_Guest" or "Starbucks_WiFi." Tap the network name to connect.

### Step 3: Enter the password if asked

Some networks require a password. A box will appear asking you to type it. Enter the password carefully -- it is usually case-sensitive, meaning capital and lowercase letters matter. The password is often on a card in your hotel room, on a receipt, or posted on a sign. Tap **Join** (iPhone) or **Connect** (Android).

### Step 4: Complete the login page if one appears

Many public networks show a login page (called a captive portal) after you connect. This page may ask you to accept terms and conditions, enter your room number, provide an email address, or tap a button that says **Connect** or **Accept**. Follow the instructions on the screen. If the page does not appear automatically, open your web browser and try visiting any website.

### Step 5: Verify you are connected

Once connected, you should see the **Wi-Fi symbol** at the top of your screen (it looks like a small fan or curved lines). Open your web browser and try loading a website to confirm the internet is working.

### Step 6: Forget the network when you leave

When you leave the hotel or cafe, it is a good idea to forget the network so your phone does not automatically connect to it in the future. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, **Wi-Fi**, tap the **i** icon next to the network name, and tap **Forget This Network**. On Android, go to **Settings**, **Wi-Fi**, tap and hold the network name, and tap **Forget**.

## Tips

- Do not enter banking details or passwords while on public Wi-Fi. Wait until you are on a secure network or use your mobile data.
- If the Wi-Fi asks for personal information like your email, you can use a secondary email address you do not mind sharing.
- If you travel often, consider using a VPN app for extra security on public networks.
- Some airports offer free Wi-Fi for a limited time. Look for a "Free Wi-Fi" option if you see multiple networks.
