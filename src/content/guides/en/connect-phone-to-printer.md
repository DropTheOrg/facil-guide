  - question: "Does my printer need to be wireless?"
    answer: "For the easiest setup, yes. Most modern printers have Wi-Fi built in. If your printer is older and only connects by USB cable, you may need a computer to print. Check your printer manual or look for a Wi-Fi symbol on the printer."
  - question: "Do I need to install an app to print?"
    answer: "On iPhone, no app is needed if your printer supports AirPrint (most modern printers do). On Android, no app is needed if your printer supports the built-in print service. For some printer brands, you may get better results by installing the manufacturer's free app (like HP Smart or Epson iPrint)."
  - question: "Can I print photos from my phone?"
    answer: "Yes. Open any photo in your gallery, tap the share button, and select Print. For best results, use photo paper in your printer and select photo quality in the print settings."
  - question: "Why can I not find my printer?"
    answer: "Make sure your printer is turned on, connected to Wi-Fi, and on the same Wi-Fi network as your phone. If it still does not appear, try restarting both your printer and your phone."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to print documents, photos, and emails directly from your phone. You will connect your phone to a wireless printer over Wi-Fi and print without needing a computer.

## What you need

- A phone (iPhone or Android)
- A wireless printer connected to your Wi-Fi network
- Both your phone and printer must be on the same Wi-Fi network

## Steps

### Step 1: Make sure your printer is connected to Wi-Fi

Check that your printer is turned on and connected to your home Wi-Fi network. Most printers show a Wi-Fi icon on their display when connected. If your printer is not yet connected to Wi-Fi, check the printer's settings menu and look for **Wireless Setup** or **Network Settings**. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect it to your Wi-Fi.

### Step 2: Connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi network

Make sure your phone is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your printer. Go to **Settings** on your phone, tap **Wi-Fi**, and check that you are on your home network. If your phone is on mobile data or a different network, the printer will not be found.

### Step 3: Open the document or photo you want to print

Find what you want to print on your phone. This could be a photo in your gallery, a document in your email, a web page in your browser, or a PDF file. Open it so it is displayed on your screen.

### Step 4: Tap the share or menu button

Look for the **share** button or the **three dots** menu. On iPhone, the share button is a square with an upward arrow. On Android, look for three dots in the top-right corner or a share icon. Tap it to see the list of options.

### Step 5: Select Print

In the list of options, scroll down and tap **Print**. On iPhone, you may need to scroll the bottom row of icons to find it. On Android, it may be under **More** or directly visible in the menu. A print preview screen will appear showing how your document will look when printed.

### Step 6: Choose your printer and settings

On the print preview screen, tap **Select Printer** or **Printer** at the top. Your phone will search for nearby printers. Tap your printer's name when it appears. Then adjust settings if needed: choose the number of **copies**, select **colour** or **black and white**, and pick the **paper size**. Most of the time, the default settings work fine.

### Step 7: Tap Print

When everything looks right on the preview, tap the **Print** button. Your phone will send the document to the printer. Wait a moment and your document will start printing. Do not close the app until the print job has been sent.

## Tips

- If you print often, your phone will remember your printer and select it automatically next time.
- To print a web page, open it in your browser, tap the menu or share button, and select Print. The preview will show how it will look on paper.
- For printing emails, open the email, tap the three dots menu, and select Print.
- If your printer did not come with Wi-Fi, you may be able to connect it using a USB cable to your computer and share it over the network. Ask a family member or friend to help with this setup.
