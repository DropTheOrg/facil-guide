  - question: "What do the check marks in WhatsApp mean?"
    answer: "One grey check mark means the message was sent from your phone. Two grey check marks mean it was delivered to the other person. Two blue check marks mean they have read it. A clock icon means the message has not been sent yet."
  - question: "Could the other person have blocked me?"
    answer: "If you are blocked, your messages will show one check mark forever and you will not see the person's profile photo or last seen status. However, connection problems look the same, so do not jump to conclusions."
  - question: "Will I lose my messages if I reinstall WhatsApp?"
    answer: "If you have a backup, no. WhatsApp backs up your chats automatically. When you reinstall, it will ask if you want to restore from backup. Make sure backup is enabled in Settings > Chats > Chat Backup before uninstalling."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to fix WhatsApp messages that will not send. If your messages show a small clock icon or only one check mark, it means they are stuck. This guide will help you get them through.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android) with WhatsApp installed
- An Internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data)

## The steps

### Step 1: Check your Internet connection

WhatsApp needs an Internet connection to send messages. Open your web browser and try to load any website (like google.com). If the website does not load, the problem is your Internet, not WhatsApp.

**Quick fix:** Turn **Wi-Fi** off and on again, or switch from Wi-Fi to **mobile data** (or the other way around). You can do this from your phone's quick settings by swiping down from the top of the screen.

### Step 2: Close and reopen WhatsApp

Sometimes the app just needs a fresh start.

**On iPhone:** Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hold to see your open apps. Find WhatsApp and swipe it up to close it. Then open WhatsApp again from your home screen.

**On Android:** Tap the square button (or swipe up and hold) to see open apps. Swipe WhatsApp away to close it. Open it again from your home screen.

### Step 3: Check if WhatsApp is down

Rarely, WhatsApp itself may have a problem affecting everyone. Open your web browser and search for **"is WhatsApp down"**. Websites like downdetector.com will tell you if other people are also having trouble. If WhatsApp is down, you just need to wait.

### Step 4: Restart your phone

If the Internet works and WhatsApp is not down, restart your phone. This fixes many temporary problems.

**On iPhone:** Press and hold the **Side button** and a **Volume button**, then slide to power off. Wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on.

**On Android:** Press and hold the **Power button** and tap **Restart**.

### Step 5: Update WhatsApp

An outdated version of WhatsApp can cause sending problems. Go to the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android), search for **WhatsApp**, and tap **Update** if an update is available.

### Step 6: Check your phone's date and time

If your phone's date or time is wrong, WhatsApp may not work properly.

**On iPhone:** Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Date & Time**. Make sure **"Set Automatically"** is turned on.

**On Android:** Go to **Settings** > **General Management** > **Date and Time**. Make sure **"Automatic date and time"** is turned on.

## Helpful tips

- **Check storage space**: If your phone is almost full, WhatsApp may not be able to send messages. Free up some space by deleting old photos or unused apps.
- **Reinstall as last resort**: If nothing else works, delete WhatsApp and install it again from the App Store or Play Store. Make sure your chat backup is enabled first (Settings > Chats > Chat Backup).
- **One check mark does not always mean blocked**: A single check mark usually means a connection problem on your end or the other person's phone is off. Give it some time before worrying.
