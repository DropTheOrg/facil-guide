## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to change the password of your home Wi-Fi network. This is important to keep your Internet connection secure and prevent strangers from using it.

## What you need

- A device connected to your Wi-Fi (computer, phone, or tablet)
- A web browser (Safari, Chrome, or Firefox)
- Your router login details (usually printed on a sticker on your router)

## The steps

### Step 1: Find your router's address

Your router has a special address you type into your web browser. The most common addresses are **192.168.1.1** or **192.168.0.1**. This address is often printed on a sticker on the bottom or back of your router.

### Step 2: Open your router's settings page

Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, or Firefox). In the address bar at the top, type the router address (for example **192.168.1.1**) and press **Enter** or **Go**. A login page will appear.

### Step 3: Log in to your router

Enter the **username** and **password** for your router. These are not the same as your Wi-Fi password. The default login is often printed on the router sticker. Common defaults are "admin" for both username and password.

If you changed these before and cannot remember them, you may need to reset your router by pressing the small reset button on the back with a paperclip for 10 seconds.

### Step 4: Find the Wi-Fi settings

Look for a section called **"Wireless"**, **"Wi-Fi"**, or **"Wireless Settings"**. This is usually in the main menu on the left side or at the top of the page. Tap or click on it.

### Step 5: Change the password

Find the field called **"Password"**, **"Passphrase"**, or **"Pre-Shared Key"**. Delete the old password and type your new one. Make it at least 12 characters long with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

Write down your new password on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere safe.

### Step 6: Save your changes

Click the **"Save"** or **"Apply"** button. Your router may restart, which takes about one minute. Once it is back on, connect your devices using the new password.

## Helpful tips

- **Write it down**: Keep your new password written on paper near your router so you do not forget it.
- **Reconnect your devices**: After changing the password, you will need to enter the new password on every device (phones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs).
- **Security type**: If you see an option for security type, choose **WPA2** or **WPA3**. These are the most secure options.
- **Router brand help**: If you cannot find the settings, search online for your router brand name followed by "change Wi-Fi password" for specific instructions.
