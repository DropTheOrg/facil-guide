## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use Google Maps on your phone to find places, get directions, and follow turn-by-turn navigation to your destination. This works for driving, walking, cycling, and public transport.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- Google Maps app installed (free from the App Store or Google Play)
- An internet connection
- Location services turned on

## The steps

### Step 1: Open Google Maps

Find the **Google Maps** app on your phone and tap it. It has a colorful map pin icon. If you do not have it installed, download it for free from the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android).

### Step 2: Search for a place

Tap the **search bar** at the top of the screen. Type the name of the place you want to go, such as a restaurant name, an address, or a city. Tap a result from the list that appears. The map will show the location with a red pin.

### Step 3: Tap Directions

Once you see the place on the map, tap the blue **Directions** button at the bottom of the screen. Google Maps will calculate the best route from your current location to the destination.

### Step 4: Choose how you want to travel

At the top of the screen, you will see icons for different travel methods. Tap the **car icon** for driving, the **person icon** for walking, the **train icon** for public transport, or the **bicycle icon** for cycling. The estimated travel time changes depending on which option you choose.

### Step 5: Review the route

You will see the route drawn as a blue line on the map. The estimated time and distance appear at the bottom. If there are multiple route options, you can tap the gray lines on the map to choose a different route. Review the route to make sure it looks correct.

### Step 6: Start navigation

Tap the blue **Start** button at the bottom of the screen. Your phone will begin giving you voice directions. Follow the instructions as they appear on the screen and are spoken out loud. The map rotates automatically to show the direction you are heading.

### Step 7: Follow the directions until you arrive

Keep following the voice instructions. The screen shows your next turn, the street name, and how far away it is. When you are close to a turn, the voice will say something like "In 200 meters, turn right." When you reach your destination, the voice will say "You have arrived at your destination."

## Tips

- Mount your phone on the dashboard or windshield if you are driving so you can see the map without looking down.
- If you miss a turn, do not worry. Google Maps will automatically recalculate a new route.
- Download the map of your area for offline use before traveling to a place with poor internet coverage.
- You can adjust the voice volume by tapping the speaker icon during navigation.
