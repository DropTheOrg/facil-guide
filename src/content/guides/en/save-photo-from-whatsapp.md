## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to save a photo that someone sent you on WhatsApp to your iPhone. Once saved, the photo will be in your Photos app and you can view, share, or print it anytime.

## What you need

- An iPhone with WhatsApp installed
- A photo received in a WhatsApp conversation

## The steps

### Step 1: Open WhatsApp

Tap the green **WhatsApp** icon on your home screen to open the app.

### Step 2: Open the conversation

Find the conversation that contains the photo you want to save. **Tap on the person's name** to open the chat.

### Step 3: Find the photo

Scroll through the conversation until you find the **photo** you want to save. Tap on the photo to open it in full screen.

### Step 4: Tap the share button

In the bottom left corner of the screen, tap the **share icon** (a square with an arrow pointing up).

### Step 5: Tap Save

In the menu that appears, tap **"Save"**. The photo will be saved to your iPhone's Photos app. You will find it in the **"Recents"** album.

## Helpful tips

- **Automatic saving**: You can turn on automatic saving so all WhatsApp photos save to your phone. Go to WhatsApp **Settings** > **Chats** > turn on **"Save to Camera Roll"**. Be aware this saves all photos and may use storage.
- **Storage space**: If you receive many photos, they can fill up your phone's storage. Check your storage regularly in **Settings** > **General** > **iPhone Storage**.
- **Photo quality**: Photos saved from WhatsApp are slightly compressed. If you need the full quality version, ask the person to send it as a document instead of a photo.
