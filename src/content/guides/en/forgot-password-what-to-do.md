## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn what to do when you forget your password. Whether it is your email, an app like WhatsApp or Facebook, or your phone itself, there is almost always a way to get back in.

## What you need

- Access to the phone number or email address linked to your account
- A computer, phone, or tablet with Internet access

## The steps

### Step 1: Do not panic

Forgetting a password happens to everyone. Your account and all your information are still safe. You just need to prove who you are to get a new password.

### Step 2: Go to the login page

Open the app or website where you forgot your password. On the login screen, look for a link that says **"Forgot password?"**, **"Reset password"**, or **"Need help signing in?"**. Tap or click on it.

### Step 3: Enter your email or phone number

The service will ask you to type your **email address** or **phone number** that is linked to your account. Type it carefully and tap **"Next"** or **"Continue"**.

### Step 4: Check for a verification code

The service will send you a **verification code**. This is a short number (usually 6 digits) sent to your phone as a text message or to your email. Open your messages or email to find it. The code usually arrives within one minute.

### Step 5: Enter the code and create a new password

Go back to the password reset page and type in the **verification code** you received. Then you will be asked to create a **new password**. Choose a password that is at least 8 characters long and mixes letters and numbers.

**Write your new password down** on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place at home.

### Step 6: Sign in with your new password

Go back to the login page and sign in using your **email address** and your **new password**. You are now back in your account.

If you use the same password on other services, remember to update it there too.

## Helpful tips

- **Write passwords down**: Keep a small notebook at home with your passwords. This is the safest way for most people to remember them.
- **Use different passwords**: Try not to use the same password everywhere. If one account gets compromised, the others stay safe.
- **Recovery email**: When you create an account, always add a recovery email address or phone number. This is what allows you to reset your password later.
- **Common services**: Here are the password reset pages for popular services:
  - Gmail: [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
  - Facebook: [facebook.com/login/identify](https://www.facebook.com/login/identify)
  - WhatsApp: WhatsApp uses your phone number and a verification code sent by SMS
  - Apple ID: [iforgot.apple.com](https://iforgot.apple.com)
