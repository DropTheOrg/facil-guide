faq:
  - question: "What is a QR code?"
    answer: "A QR code is a small square image made of black and white patterns. It contains information -- usually a website link. When you scan it with your phone camera, it opens that link automatically."
  - question: "Do I need to install an app to scan QR codes?"
    answer: "No. On iPhone and most Android phones made after 2018, the built-in camera app can scan QR codes automatically. You do not need a separate app."
  - question: "Why is my camera not recognizing the QR code?"
    answer: "Make sure the QR code is well-lit and your camera is focused. Hold the phone steady, about 15-25 cm (6-10 inches) from the code. If it still does not work, check that QR code scanning is enabled in your camera settings."
  - question: "Is it safe to scan QR codes?"
    answer: "QR codes from trusted sources (restaurants, shops, official documents) are safe. Be careful with QR codes from unknown sources -- they could link to suspicious websites. If the link looks strange after scanning, do not tap on it."
  - question: "Can I scan a QR code from a picture on my screen?"
    answer: "On iPhone, you can press and hold on a QR code image in Photos or Safari and your phone will read it. On Android, Google Lens can read QR codes from screenshots."

## What You Will Need

- Your iPhone or Android phone
- A QR code to scan (on paper, a screen, or a poster)

## Step 1: Open Your Camera

Pick up your phone and open the **Camera** app. This is the same app you use to take photos.

- **On iPhone:** Tap the Camera icon on your home screen
- **On Android:** Tap the Camera icon on your home screen or swipe from the lock screen

You do not need to take a photo. Just open the camera.

## Step 2: Point Your Camera at the QR Code

Hold your phone so the camera can see the QR code. Keep the phone about **15 to 25 centimeters** (6 to 10 inches) from the code.

Make sure:
- The entire QR code is visible on your screen
- The code is well-lit (not in shadow)
- Your hand is steady

## Step 3: Wait for Your Phone to Recognize It

Your phone will automatically detect the QR code. You do not need to press any button.

- **On iPhone:** A yellow notification will appear at the top of the screen with a link
- **On Android:** A small banner or bubble will appear with the link

This usually takes 1 to 3 seconds. Keep the phone still.

## Step 4: Tap the Link

When the notification or banner appears:

- **On iPhone:** Tap the yellow notification at the top of the screen
- **On Android:** Tap the link or banner that appeared

This will open the website or content that the QR code contains. It usually opens in your web browser (Safari or Chrome).

## Step 5: If It Does Not Work

If your camera does not recognize the QR code:

1. **Check the lighting.** Move to a brighter area or turn on a light
2. **Clean your camera.** Wipe the camera lens gently with a soft cloth
3. **Try a different distance.** Move your phone closer or further from the code
4. **Check your settings:**
   - On iPhone: Go to **Settings** > **Camera** > Make sure **Scan QR Codes** is turned on
   - On Android: Open **Camera** > Tap **Settings** (gear icon) > Look for **Scan QR codes** and turn it on

If nothing works, ask someone nearby for help. Some older phones may need a free QR code reader app from the App Store or Google Play.

## You Did It!

You now know how to scan any QR code. You will find them everywhere -- restaurant menus, bus stops, event tickets, product packaging, and even in guides like this one.
