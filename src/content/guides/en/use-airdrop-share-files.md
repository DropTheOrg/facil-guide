faq:
  - question: "Does AirDrop use my internet or mobile data?"
    answer: "No. AirDrop uses Bluetooth and a direct Wi-Fi connection between the two devices. It does not use your internet connection or mobile data. Both devices need Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on, but they do not need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network."
  - question: "Can I use AirDrop with Android phones?"
    answer: "No. AirDrop only works between Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, and Mac). To share files with an Android phone, you can use other methods like WhatsApp, email, or Google's Nearby Share."
  - question: "How close do the devices need to be?"
    answer: "The two devices should be within about 9 meters (30 feet) of each other. The closer they are, the faster and more reliable the transfer will be."
  - question: "Is AirDrop safe? Can strangers send me things?"
    answer: "AirDrop is safe if you set it correctly. You can choose to receive files from Contacts Only, which means only people in your contacts list can send you things. You can also turn AirDrop off completely when you are not using it."
  - question: "What types of files can I send with AirDrop?"
    answer: "You can send almost anything: photos, videos, documents, website links, contacts, notes, and even app content. If something has a share button, you can usually send it with AirDrop."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to use AirDrop to send photos, videos, documents, and other files from one Apple device to another. AirDrop is a built-in feature on iPhone, iPad, and Mac that lets you share files wirelessly without using email, messaging apps, or the internet. It is fast, free, and very easy to use.

## What you need

- Two Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, or Mac)
- Both devices need Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on
- The devices should be within about 9 meters (30 feet) of each other

### Step 1: Turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on both devices

AirDrop needs both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to work. On both devices:

- **On iPhone or iPad:** Open **Settings**, tap **Wi-Fi** and make sure it is on. Go back to **Settings**, tap **Bluetooth** and make sure it is on. You can also swipe down from the top right corner to open **Control Center** and check that both icons are blue.
- **On Mac:** Click the **Wi-Fi** icon in the top menu bar and make sure it is on. Click the **Control Center** icon and make sure **Bluetooth** is on.

### Step 2: Set AirDrop to receive files

You need to tell your device who can send you files via AirDrop.

- **On iPhone or iPad:** Open **Settings**, tap **General**, then tap **AirDrop**. Choose **Contacts Only** (recommended) or **Everyone for 10 Minutes** if the sender is not in your contacts.
- **On Mac:** Open **Finder**, click **AirDrop** in the left sidebar. At the bottom of the window, click **Allow me to be discovered by** and choose **Contacts Only** or **Everyone**.

### Step 3: Open the file you want to share

On the device that is sending, find the file you want to share. For example:

- To send a photo, open the **Photos** app and find the photo.
- To send a document, open the **Files** app and find the document.
- To send a website link, open **Safari** and go to the page you want to share.

### Step 4: Tap the Share button

Look for the **Share** button. It looks like a square with an arrow pointing up. You will find it at the bottom of the screen in most apps, or in the toolbar. Tap it to open the sharing options.

### Step 5: Choose AirDrop and select the receiver

In the sharing menu, you will see **AirDrop** as one of the options near the top. Tap it. Your phone will search for nearby Apple devices. After a moment, you will see the name or picture of the person or device you want to send to. Tap their name or device icon to start sending.

### Step 6: Accept the file on the receiving device

On the receiving device, a notification will appear showing a preview of the file being sent and who is sending it. Tap **Accept** to receive the file. The file will be saved automatically:

- Photos and videos go to the **Photos** app.
- Documents, web links, and other files open in the appropriate app, or you can choose where to save them.

If the sender is already in your contacts and you are both signed into iCloud, the file may be accepted automatically without a prompt.

### Step 7: Turn AirDrop back to Contacts Only

After you finish sharing, it is a good practice to set AirDrop back to **Contacts Only** for safety. This prevents strangers in public places from sending you unwanted files. Go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **AirDrop**, and choose **Contacts Only**.

## Tips

- If the receiving device does not appear, make sure both devices have AirDrop turned on, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled, and are close to each other.
- You can send multiple photos at once. In the Photos app, tap **Select**, choose all the photos you want, then tap the Share button.
- If you are sending to your own devices (for example, from your iPhone to your Mac), make sure both are signed into the same Apple ID. Files will be accepted automatically.
- Disable Personal Hotspot on both devices before using AirDrop, as it can interfere with the connection.
