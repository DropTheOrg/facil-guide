## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to join a Zoom video call when someone sends you a meeting link. Zoom is a popular app used for video calls with family, friends, or doctors.

## What you need

- A phone, tablet, or computer
- The Zoom app (free to download) or a web browser
- A meeting link or meeting ID from the person who invited you

## The steps

### Step 1: Get the Zoom app

If you do not have Zoom installed, download it for free:
- **iPhone**: Open the **App Store**, search for **Zoom Workplace**, and tap **Get**.
- **Android**: Open the **Play Store**, search for **Zoom Workplace**, and tap **Install**.
- **Computer**: Go to **zoom.us/download** and download Zoom Desktop Client.

### Step 2: Open the meeting link

When someone invites you to a Zoom meeting, they usually send a link (it starts with **https://zoom.us/**). Tap or click this link. The Zoom app will open automatically.

### Step 3: Enter your name

If Zoom asks for your name, type the name you want other people to see during the meeting. This is usually your first name.

### Step 4: Choose your audio and video

Zoom will ask how you want to join audio. Tap **Join with Internet Audio** (or **Call Using Internet Audio**). If you want others to see you, make sure your camera is turned on by tapping the camera icon.

### Step 5: You are in the meeting

You will now see the other people in the meeting on your screen. To leave when you are done, tap **Leave** in the top right corner (or bottom on some devices) and confirm.

## Helpful tips

- **Mute yourself**: Tap the **microphone icon** at the bottom of the screen to mute yourself when you are not speaking. This keeps background noise out.
- **Gallery view**: If you want to see everyone at once instead of just the speaker, tap **Gallery View** (usually in the top right or by swiping).
- **Chat**: Tap the **Chat** icon to send text messages to everyone in the meeting without interrupting the speaker.
