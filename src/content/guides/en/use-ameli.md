## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to access and use your Ameli account to manage your French health insurance. You will learn how to check if a doctor visit has been reimbursed, download official documents, and update your personal details. Ameli is the online service of the Assurance Maladie, which is the public health insurance system in France.

## What you need

- A French social security number (numéro de sécurité sociale)
- A phone, tablet, or computer with internet access
- An email address linked to your Ameli account
- Your Ameli password (or your FranceConnect login)

## The steps

### Step 1: Download the Ameli app or open the website

On your phone, download the **Ameli** app from the **App Store** (iPhone) or **Google Play Store** (Android). You can also open your internet browser and go to [ameli.fr](https://www.ameli.fr).

### Step 2: Log in to your account

Tap **Mon compte** (My account) at the top of the screen. Enter your social security number (13 digits, found on your carte Vitale or any Ameli letter) and your password. You can also tap **FranceConnect** to log in using your FranceConnect credentials instead.

### Step 3: Check your reimbursements

Once logged in, tap **Mes paiements** (My payments) in the menu. This shows a list of all your recent medical expenses and how much has been reimbursed by the Assurance Maladie. Each line shows the date, the healthcare provider, the amount charged, and the amount reimbursed.

### Step 4: Download an attestation

To get a proof of insurance document, tap **Mes démarches** (My procedures) and then tap **Obtenir une attestation** (Get an attestation). Choose the type of attestation you need, such as **Attestation de droits** (proof of rights). Tap **Download** and the document will be saved as a PDF on your device.

### Step 5: Update your personal information

If you moved to a new address or changed your bank account, tap **Mon profil** (My profile). Here you can update your address, phone number, email, and bank details for receiving reimbursements. Changes usually take effect within a few days.

### Step 6: Order a new carte Vitale

If your carte Vitale is lost, stolen, or damaged, tap **Mes démarches** and then **Commander une carte Vitale** (Order a carte Vitale). Follow the instructions to upload a passport photo and confirm your address. The new card will be mailed to you in a few weeks.

### Step 7: Contact your local health insurance office

If you have a question that you cannot resolve online, tap **Mes messages** (My messages) to send a secure message to your CPAM office. You can also find your local office address and phone number under **Mon organisme** (My office).

## Tips

- Check your reimbursements about 5 days after a doctor visit. It usually takes 3 to 7 days for the reimbursement to appear.
- Keep your email address up to date in Ameli so you receive notifications about new reimbursements and important letters.
- If you have a mutuelle (supplementary health insurance), the remaining amount after Ameli's reimbursement is usually paid automatically by your mutuelle if it is linked.
- You can set up notifications in the Ameli app to be alerted each time a new reimbursement is processed.
