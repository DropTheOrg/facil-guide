## What you will learn

You will learn how to use the Reminders app that comes with your iPhone to create lists, add tasks with dates and times, organize your reminders, and share lists with family members.

## What you need

- An iPhone running iOS 15 or later
- The Reminders app (it comes pre-installed on every iPhone)

### Step 1: Open the Reminders app

Find the **Reminders** app on your home screen. It has a white icon with colorful bullet points. Tap it to open. You will see a screen with default lists like **Reminders** and options to create new ones.

### Step 2: Create a new reminder

Tap **New Reminder** at the bottom-left corner of the screen. A text field will appear. Type what you want to remember, such as "Buy milk" or "Call the doctor." Tap **Done** on the keyboard to save it.

### Step 3: Add a date and time

To be reminded at a specific time, tap on the reminder you just created. Tap the **calendar icon** to add a date. Tap the **clock icon** to add a time. For example, you can set a reminder for "Call the doctor" at 9:00 AM tomorrow. Your phone will send you a notification at that exact time.

### Step 4: Create a list to organize your reminders

Tap **Add List** at the bottom-right of the main screen. Give your list a name, such as "Shopping," "Health," or "Family." Choose a color and an icon. Tap **Done**. You can now add reminders to this specific list to keep things organized.

### Step 5: Move a reminder to a different list

If you want to move a reminder from one list to another, tap on the reminder to open it. Tap **List** and choose the list you want to move it to. This helps you keep related reminders together.

### Step 6: Set a recurring reminder

Open a reminder and tap the **date** field. Tap **Repeat** and choose how often you want the reminder to come back: **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Yearly**. This is useful for regular tasks like taking medication every morning or watering plants every week.

### Step 7: Share a list with family

Open the list you want to share. Tap the **three dots** icon in the top-right corner, then tap **Share List**. Enter the name or email address of the person you want to share with. They will receive an invitation. Once they accept, both of you can add, edit, and complete reminders on that list.

## Tips

- Use Siri to create reminders quickly by saying "Hey Siri, remind me to..." followed by your task
- Tap the circle next to a reminder to mark it as done
- Swipe left on a reminder to delete it
- Use the Flagged section on the main screen for your most important reminders
- You can also set location-based reminders that notify you when you arrive at or leave a specific place
