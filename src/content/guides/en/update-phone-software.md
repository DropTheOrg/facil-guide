faq:
  - question: "Will updating my phone delete my photos or messages?"
    answer: "No. A software update does not delete your photos, messages, contacts, or apps. Everything stays exactly where it is. It is still a good idea to have a backup just in case."
  - question: "How long does an update take?"
    answer: "Most updates take between 10 and 30 minutes. Large updates (like a new major version) can take up to an hour. Your phone will restart during the process."
  - question: "What if I do not have enough storage for the update?"
    answer: "If your phone says there is not enough space, delete some apps, photos, or videos you no longer need. You can also offload unused apps on iPhone (Settings, General, iPhone Storage) to free space temporarily."
  - question: "Can I use my phone during an update?"
    answer: "No. During the installation phase, your phone will restart and show a progress bar. You cannot use it until the update finishes. Make sure to start the update when you do not need your phone for a while."
  - question: "What if the update fails?"
    answer: "If an update fails, try restarting your phone and attempting the update again. Make sure you have a strong Wi-Fi connection and at least 50 percent battery. If it keeps failing, connect your iPhone to a computer with iTunes or Finder, or visit a phone repair shop for Android."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to check for and install software updates on your phone. Keeping your phone updated gives you new features, fixes problems, and protects you from security threats.

## What you need

- Your phone (iPhone or Android)
- A Wi-Fi connection (updates are large and should not be downloaded on mobile data)
- At least 50 percent battery (or plug in your charger)
- About 15 to 30 minutes

## The steps

### Step 1: Connect to Wi-Fi

Software updates are large files and should be downloaded over Wi-Fi. Open **Settings** and tap **Wi-Fi**. Connect to your home Wi-Fi network or another trusted network. Wait until you see the Wi-Fi symbol at the top of your screen.

### Step 2: Check your battery level

Your phone needs enough battery to complete the update. Look at the battery icon in the top right corner of your screen. If it is below 50 percent, plug in your charger before starting. Your phone may refuse to update with a low battery.

### Step 3: Find the software update screen on iPhone

On iPhone, open **Settings**, tap **General**, then tap **Software Update**. Your phone will check for available updates. If an update is available, you will see its name and a description of what it includes.

### Step 4: Find the software update screen on Android

On Android, open **Settings**, then tap **System** (or **About phone** on some models), then tap **Software update** or **System update**. Your phone will check for available updates. On Samsung phones, go to **Settings**, then **Software update**, then **Download and install**.

### Step 5: Download and install the update

Tap **Download and Install** (or **Install Now** if it has already downloaded). Your phone will download the update file, which may take several minutes depending on your Wi-Fi speed. When the download is complete, your phone will ask you to confirm the installation. Tap **Install** or **Restart and Install**.

### Step 6: Wait for the update to finish

Your phone will restart and show a progress bar or the Apple logo. **Do not turn off your phone** during this process. Wait patiently until your phone shows the lock screen again. Enter your passcode to unlock it. The update is complete.

## Tips

- Turn on automatic updates so you never miss an important security fix. On iPhone, go to **Settings**, then **General**, then **Software Update**, then **Automatic Updates**. On Android, go to **Settings**, then **System**, then **Software update**, and enable auto-updates.
- Update your phone in the evening before bed so it can finish while you sleep.
- If you are worried about changes, read the update description before installing to see what is new.
