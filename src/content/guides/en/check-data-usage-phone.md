  - question: "What is mobile data?"
    answer: "Mobile data is the internet connection your phone uses when you are not connected to Wi-Fi. It uses your carrier's network (4G or 5G) and is usually included in your phone plan up to a certain limit, such as 5 GB or 20 GB per month."
  - question: "What happens if I use too much data?"
    answer: "If you go over your data limit, your carrier may slow down your internet speed for the rest of the month, charge you extra for the additional data, or both. Checking your usage helps you avoid surprises on your bill."
  - question: "Does Wi-Fi count as mobile data?"
    answer: "No. When your phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network, it uses that network for internet instead of mobile data. Activities on Wi-Fi (like watching videos at home) do not count toward your data limit."
  - question: "Which apps use the most data?"
    answer: "Video streaming apps (YouTube, Netflix), video calls (FaceTime, WhatsApp video), social media with lots of videos (Facebook, TikTok, Instagram), and music streaming (Spotify) typically use the most data. Text messages and emails use very little."
  - question: "How can I use less data?"
    answer: "Connect to Wi-Fi whenever possible, especially at home. Turn off mobile data for apps that do not need it. Avoid watching videos or downloading large files when not on Wi-Fi. Many apps also have a data saver or low data mode in their settings."

## What you will learn

In this guide, you will learn how to check how much mobile data your phone has used. You will also learn how to see which apps use the most data and how to set limits or warnings so you do not go over your plan. This helps you avoid extra charges on your phone bill.

## What you need

- An iPhone or Android phone with a mobile data plan

### Step 1: Check data usage on iPhone

To see how much mobile data you have used on an iPhone:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Mobile Data** (or **Cellular** in some regions)
3. Look at the number next to **Current Period** near the top of the screen

This shows the total amount of data you have used since the counter was last reset. Below that, you will see a list of all your apps with the amount of data each one has used. The apps that use the most data appear at the top.

### Step 2: Check data usage on Android

To see how much mobile data you have used on an Android phone:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Network and internet** (or **Connections** on Samsung phones)
3. Tap **Mobile data usage** or **Data usage**
4. You will see a graph showing your data usage for the current period

Below the graph, you will see a list of apps sorted by how much data they have used. Tap any app to see more details about its data use.

### Step 3: Check your remaining data with your carrier

Your phone shows how much data you have used, but to see how much data you have left in your plan, you usually need to check with your carrier:

- **Check your carrier's app:** Most carriers have a free app (such as My Vodafone, My O2, T-Mobile, or similar). Download it from the App Store or Google Play Store, sign in, and it will show your remaining data.
- **Send a text message:** Many carriers let you check your balance by sending a short code via SMS. For example, some carriers use *100# or a similar number. Check your carrier's website for the correct code.
- **Call your carrier:** You can call your carrier's customer service number and ask about your current data usage.

### Step 4: Set a data usage warning

You can tell your phone to warn you when you are getting close to your data limit.

- **On iPhone:** Go to **Settings**, then **Mobile Data**. Unfortunately, iPhone does not have a built-in data limit warning. You can reset the counter at the start of each billing period by scrolling to the bottom and tapping **Reset Statistics**, then check it regularly. For automatic warnings, use your carrier's app.
- **On Android:** Go to **Settings**, then **Network and internet**, then **Mobile data usage**. Tap the gear icon or look for **Data warning and limit**. Turn on **Set data warning** and enter the amount (for example, 4 GB if your plan is 5 GB). Your phone will notify you when you reach that amount.

### Step 5: Set a data limit (Android only)

On Android, you can also set a hard limit that stops mobile data when you reach a certain amount:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Tap **Network and internet**
3. Tap **Mobile data usage**
4. Tap **Data warning and limit**
5. Turn on **Set data limit**
6. Enter your data limit amount

When you reach this limit, your phone will turn off mobile data automatically. You can turn it back on manually if needed, but this prevents accidental overuse.

### Step 6: Reduce data usage for specific apps

If certain apps are using too much data, you can restrict their background data use:

- **On iPhone:** Go to **Settings**, then **Mobile Data**. Scroll down to the list of apps and turn off the switch next to any app you do not want to use mobile data. That app will only work on Wi-Fi.
- **On Android:** Go to **Settings**, then **Network and internet**, then **Mobile data usage**. Tap the app you want to restrict. Turn on **Restrict background data**. The app will still work on Wi-Fi but will use less mobile data.

## Tips

- Connect to Wi-Fi at home, at work, and at friends' houses whenever possible. This saves your mobile data for when you really need it.
- Downloading music or videos for offline use while on Wi-Fi is a great way to enjoy them later without using data.
- Video uses the most data. One hour of video streaming can use 1 to 3 GB of data. Watch videos on Wi-Fi when you can.
- Check your data usage once a week so you are never surprised by your phone bill.
