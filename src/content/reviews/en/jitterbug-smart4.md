## Who is this phone for?

The Jitterbug Smart4 by Lively is a smartphone designed specifically for people who want simplicity above all else. If regular smartphones feel too complicated, this phone might be right for you.

## What we like

### A large, readable screen

The 6.2-inch screen is generous. Text is displayed in large size by default, and icons are clear and well-spaced. No squinting needed.

### An interface designed for clarity

Instead of the usual Android system with dozens of apps, the Jitterbug presents a simple list with large buttons: Calls, Messages, Photos, Health. Every function is accessible in one or two taps.

### Daily safety

The emergency button on the back of the phone provides real peace of mind. In case of trouble, a long press connects you with an emergency operator who knows your location.

## What could be better

### Apps

If you want to use popular apps like Instagram or Netflix, you will be limited. The Jitterbug app store is restricted compared to an iPhone or Samsung.

### The camera

The camera gets the job done for family photos, but do not expect iPhone quality. For everyday memories, it is sufficient.

## Our verdict

**Rating: 4.5 / 5**

The Jitterbug Smart4 does exactly what it promises: make smartphones accessible to everyone. If your priority is simplicity and safety rather than the latest features, this is an excellent choice.
