# Facil.guide — EU Funding Analysis

> Written 2026-02-19. Honest assessment of EU funding opportunities, amounts, effort, and timing.

---

## TL;DR

**Worth it? Maybe, but not now.** EU grants pay well (50K-500K range for our profile) but the application process is brutal and designed for organizations, not solo founders. Wait until we have traction (10K+ monthly visitors) and potentially a legal entity (nonprofit or social enterprise). Then apply.

**Best bet:** Erasmus+ KA2 Small-Scale Partnership (max 60K, simpler application) or national-level digital inclusion grants (less bureaucracy than EU-level).

## What's Available

### 1. Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Budget | 7.5B total (2021-2027), ~1B/year |
| Our fit | "Advanced Digital Skills" pillar |
| Grant size | 1-2M per project (too big for us alone) |
| Co-funding | 50% (we'd need to match) |
| Who can apply | Consortia of 3+ organizations from 3+ EU countries |
| Application | Heavy — 50-80 page proposals, financial audits, work packages |
| Timeline | Calls open annually, 3-6 month evaluation |
| **Verdict** | **Not for us now.** Designed for consortia of universities/NGOs/companies. We could JOIN a consortium as a content partner, but not lead one. |

### 2. Erasmus+ (Education & Training)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Budget | 26.2B total (2021-2027), ~5.2B in 2026 |
| Our fit | KA2 — Cooperation Partnerships (Adult Education) |
| Relevant | "Digital skills for adults" explicitly mentioned |

**Two levels:**

**KA2 Small-Scale Partnership:**
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Grant | Lump sum: 30,000 or 60,000 EUR |
| Duration | 6-24 months |
| Partners | Minimum 2 organizations from 2 EU countries |
| Application | Simplified (15-20 pages) |
| Co-funding | 0% — lump sum, no matching required |
| **Verdict** | **Best option for us.** Small enough, manageable application, we just need 1 partner org in another EU country. 60K covers a lot of guide production + outreach. |

**KA2 Cooperation Partnership:**
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Grant | 120,000 / 250,000 / 400,000 EUR |
| Duration | 12-36 months |
| Partners | Minimum 3 organizations from 3 EU countries |
| Application | Medium complexity (30-40 pages) |
| Co-funding | 0% — lump sum |
| **Verdict** | **Possible at 250K level** if we have traction and 2 partner orgs (e.g., a French library network + an Italian senior organization). |

### 3. European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Budget | 99.3B total (2021-2027) |
| Our fit | Digital skills for disadvantaged groups |
| How it works | Managed at NATIONAL level, not EU level |
| **Verdict** | **Check each country's national ESF+ calls.** Portugal's is managed by POISE, France by FSE+, Italy by PON. These are often easier to access than EU-level calls. Less competition, more local. |

### 4. National-Level Grants (Easiest)

| Country | Program | Amount | Fit |
|---------|---------|--------|-----|
| France | "France Num" vouchers | 5-20K | SME digital transformation |
| France | "Aidants Connect" partnerships | Varies | Content partnerships for digital helpers |
| Portugal | "Portugal Digital" grants | 10-50K | Digital inclusion projects |
| Portugal | PRR (Recovery Plan) | Varies | Digital skills pillar |
| Italy | PNRR Digital Pillar | Varies | Administered by AGID |
| Spain | Kit Digital | 2-12K | SME digitization |

**These are the lowest-hanging fruit.** Less paperwork, faster decisions, local language applications.

## What We'd Need to Apply

### For Erasmus+ KA2 Small-Scale (recommended first step)

1. **A legal entity** — Facil needs to be a registered organization. Options:
   - Portuguese "Associacao" (nonprofit association) — cheapest, ~200 EUR to register
   - French "Association loi 1901" — free to register
   - EU nonprofit of any member state

2. **One partner organization** — Another org in a different EU country. Could be:
   - A library that already wants our content
   - A senior organization we've built a relationship with
   - A university digital literacy department

3. **A project proposal** — describing what we'd produce with the grant (guides, translations, outreach)

4. **No financial audit** — small-scale partnerships use lump sums, no receipts needed

### Timeline to Apply
- **Now → Month 3:** Build traction, build relationships with potential partners
- **Month 3-4:** Register legal entity (2-4 weeks)
- **Month 4-5:** Find partner org, draft proposal
- **Month 5-6:** Submit application (next Erasmus+ deadline)
- **Month 9-12:** If approved, receive funding

### Realistic outcome
- 60K EUR grant, shared with 1 partner (so ~40-45K for Facil)
- Covers: 200+ new guides, 3 additional languages, outreach campaign
- Duration: 12-18 months
- Reporting: 1 final report (simplified for small-scale)

## Is It Worth It?

### Pros
- 40-60K in free money, no co-funding required
- Legitimacy: "EU-funded project" is a massive credibility boost
- Opens doors: government partnerships, library networks, media coverage
- The application process forces us to articulate our impact clearly

### Cons
- Time cost: 40-80 hours to prepare a good application
- Need a legal entity (one-time setup but still effort)
- Need a partner org (relationship-building time)
- Reporting obligations (even simplified)
- 6-9 month wait between application and money
- If rejected, that's 40-80 hours wasted

### Verdict

**Don't apply now. Do apply at Month 4-5.**

Right now, every hour should go into content + SEO + traction. At 10K monthly visitors, we have proof of concept. At that point:
1. Register a nonprofit (Portugal or France, whichever is easier)
2. Partner with a library or senior org we've already built a relationship with through backlink outreach
3. Apply for Erasmus+ KA2 Small-Scale (60K)
4. Use the "EU-funded" badge everywhere for credibility

The 60K is nice but the CREDIBILITY is worth 10x the money.

## Alternative: Corporate Sponsorship (Faster, Less Bureaucracy)

Instead of (or alongside) EU grants:

| Sponsor Type | Who | What We Offer | What We Get |
|-------------|-----|--------------|------------|
| Telecoms | Orange, Vodafone, NOS, TIM | "Powered by [telecom]" on guides, co-branded PDFs | 5-20K/year sponsorship |
| Device makers | Samsung, Doro | "Recommended by facil.guide" badge, device-specific guides | Product samples + sponsorship |
| Tech companies | Google, Apple | User-friendly guides for their products | Possible feature in their accessibility programs |

This is faster than EU grants and could start as soon as we have traction. A telecom sponsoring "free digital guides for seniors" is great PR for them.

## Action Items

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| Month 1-3 | Focus on content + SEO + traction. No funding applications. |
| Month 2 | Start building relationships with libraries/senior orgs (backlink outreach = future grant partners) |
| Month 3 | Check national-level grants in Portugal (PRR, Portugal Digital). Smallest paperwork. |
| Month 4 | Register legal entity if traction justifies it (10K+ visitors) |
| Month 5 | Apply for Erasmus+ KA2 Small-Scale with partner org |
| Month 6+ | Explore corporate sponsorship conversations |
