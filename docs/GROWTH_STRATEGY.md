# Facil.guide Growth Strategy: 0 to 100K Users in 12 Months

## The Problem With Our Current Approach

We're writing "how to add contact on iPhone" in 5 languages and hoping seniors find us. They won't. Here's why:

1. **Seniors don't search "senior guide."** They search exactly what everyone else searches.
2. **WikiHow (DA 93) owns every generic "how to" query.** We can't outrank them on those keywords.
3. **Google AI Overviews eat the rest.** Simple how-to queries get answered in the SERP. No click needed.
4. **Our guides are invisible.** 170 pages, zero domain authority, zero backlinks to speak of.

We're building good content that nobody can find. Strategy must change.

## The Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Senior Tech Guides)
| Site | DA | Traffic | Languages | Model |
|------|-----|---------|-----------|-------|
| WikiHow | 93 | 45.6M/mo | 19 (subdomains) | Ad-supported, generalist |
| TechBoomers | ~35 | ~500K/mo | EN only | Tutorials, ad-supported |
| Senior Planet (AARP) | ~60 | ~2M/mo | EN only | Non-profit, classes |
| GetSetUp | ~40 | ~1M/mo | EN only | Live classes, B2B |
| GCFLearnFree | ~55 | ~3M/mo | EN + ES | Free tutorials |
| **Facil.guide** | **0** | **0** | **5 langs** | **Free, static, clean** |

### What They All Miss
- None serve FR/ES/PT/IT seniors with native-quality guides
- None have a clean, ad-free, fast experience
- None offer structured learning paths (journeys)
- None have the "helper" angle (send this to your parent)
- None combine guide content + decision/comparison content

## The 360-Degree Strategy

### Angle 1: The Helper Market (Biggest Opportunity)

**Key insight from Reddit:** The #1 pain point isn't seniors searching for guides. It's their CHILDREN searching for a way to help their parents without losing their minds.

Real quotes:
- "I HATE BEING MY PARENTS' TECHNICAL SUPPORT"
- "Anything else I can try before I give up on my tech illiterate mother?"
- "My parents refuse to learn how to use tech"

**The play:** We don't target seniors directly. We target the 35-55 year olds who are tech support for their parents. They find us, they send the link to mom/dad.

**Content angle:**
- "Send this to your parents: How to connect to Wi-Fi" (actual article title)
- "A guide your mom can actually follow" (meta description)
- Landing pages for helpers: "Stop being tech support. Send these guides instead."
- Shareable guide links with "Sent with love by [name]" footer

**SEO queries to own:**
- "how to explain wifi to parents"
- "tech guide for elderly parents"
- "simple phone instructions for seniors"
- "how to help mom with iphone"
- "teaching parents technology"

These queries have ZERO competition from WikiHow. They don't write for helpers.

### Angle 2: Non-English SEO (Blue Ocean)

**Key insight:** WikiHow's non-EN coverage is garbage. fr.wikihow.com has maybe 30% of EN content. ES/PT/IT even less. For senior-specific tech queries in these languages, there is NOTHING.

**The play:** Own non-EN "how to [tech task] [device]" queries in FR, ES, PT, IT before anyone else does.

**Priority markets by opportunity:**
1. **French (FR)** - 67M speakers France + 30M Belgium/Switzerland/Canada. Senior digital literacy programs are government-funded. Low competition.
2. **Spanish (ES)** - 500M+ speakers. Latin America is digitizing fast. Elderly population growing.
3. **Portuguese (PT)** - 260M speakers. Brazil + Portugal. Almost zero competition in PT.
4. **Italian (IT)** - 65M speakers. Aging population (23% over 65 -- highest in EU).

**Content to create (per language):**
- Device setup guides (first-time iPhone/Android/tablet)
- Daily communication (WhatsApp, video calls, SMS)
- Safety (scams, passwords, privacy)
- Government/banking apps (country-specific, HUGE search volume)
- Health apps (country-specific)

### Angle 3: Decision Content (Not How-To)

**Key insight:** WikiHow only does "how to." They never do "which one" or "should I." These queries have massive search volume and commercial intent.

**Content types WikiHow can't/doesn't make:**
- "Best phone for someone who never had a smartphone" (comparison)
- "iPhone vs Android for beginners" (decision)
- "Do I need a tablet or is my phone enough?" (question)
- "Is WhatsApp safe for seniors?" (trust/safety)
- "Free vs paid antivirus: what do seniors actually need?" (recommendation)
- "What to do when you get a new iPhone: complete first week guide" (journey)

These are high-intent queries where Google AI Overviews are bad (too nuanced for a snippet) and WikiHow doesn't compete.

### Angle 4: Panic Queries (Troubleshooting)

**Key insight:** The most emotional searches happen when something goes WRONG. "My phone won't turn on." "I accidentally deleted all my photos." "My phone says storage full."

**The play:** Create troubleshooting guides for the most common panic moments. These have high search volume, high engagement, and low competition for simple, clear answers.

**Top panic queries to own:**
- "phone screen is black won't turn on"
- "accidentally deleted photos how to get back"
- "phone says storage full what to do"
- "can't remember my password"
- "phone is very slow"
- "wifi keeps disconnecting"
- "got a suspicious email what to do"
- "someone hacked my facebook"

### Angle 5: Journey-Based Content (Unique Format)

**Key insight:** Nobody offers structured learning paths. It's all isolated articles. But a senior who just got their first iPhone needs 15 guides in order, not 1 random guide.

**The play:** Create "Learning Journeys" -- ordered sequences of guides that take someone from zero to confident.

**Launch journeys:**
1. "I just got my first iPhone" (12-15 guides in order)
2. "I want to video call my grandchildren" (5 guides: setup, wifi, app install, making calls, troubleshooting)
3. "I want to be safe online" (8 guides: passwords, scams, privacy, updates)
4. "I want to use WhatsApp" (6 guides: install, contacts, messaging, photos, voice, video)
5. "I want to stop asking my kids for help" (10 guides: most common tasks)

### Angle 6: Distribution Through Helpers (Viral Loop)

**The play:** Make it dead easy for children to share guides with parents. Build a viral loop.

**Features:**
- "Send to parent" button on every guide (generates WhatsApp/SMS/email link)
- Custom message: "Hi mom, I found this guide for you. It explains how to [task] step by step."
- Helper dashboard: "I sent my mom 5 guides. She completed 3." (account feature, engagement loop)
- Print-friendly version (many seniors prefer paper)
- QR code on every guide (child prints it, sticks it on parent's fridge)

## Revenue Model (Month 10+)

1. **Affiliate (ethical):** "Best phone for seniors" comparison pages with affiliate links. Only recommend products we'd recommend to our own parents.
2. **B2B licensing:** Telecom companies (Orange, Vodafone, MEO) license our guides for their senior customer onboarding. They get white-labeled content, we get paid.
3. **Sponsored guides:** Device manufacturers sponsor specific guides. Disclosed, genuine.
4. **Premium helper features:** Dashboard for tracking which guides you sent to parents, completion notifications, custom guide packs. 5 EUR/month.
5. **Print packs:** Physical printed guide booklets sold via Amazon/direct. Seniors love paper.

## The Non-Negotiables

1. **No ads.** Ever. The guides stay clean.
2. **Free forever.** Core guides never go behind a paywall.
3. **Honest recommendations.** Never recommend something we wouldn't give to our own parents.
4. **Every guide in every language.** No second-class citizens.
5. **AI authorship disclosed.** Always.
6. **Accessibility first.** WCAG AA minimum on everything.
