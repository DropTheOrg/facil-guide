## The Competitive Landscape

### Tier 1: Large English-Only Players

| Site | Traffic | DA | Languages | Visual Style | Content Type | Weakness |
|------|---------|-----|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| WikiHow | ~45M/mo | 93 | EN (some auto-translated) | Hand-drawn illustrations (iconic, recognizable) | General how-to (100K+ articles) | AI traffic collapse (-85%), no senior focus, auto-translations are garbage |
| GCFLearnFree (now LearnFree.org) | ~3M/mo | 76 | EN + ES (partial) | Clean, minimal, intentional graphics | Digital literacy courses | Course-based (not quick guides), limited languages, institutional feel |
| Senior Planet (AARP) | ~2M/mo | 62 | EN only | Stock photos, blog-style | Classes + articles for seniors | English only, requires account for classes, US-centric |
| TechBoomers (now TechLifeUnity) | ~500K/mo | 52 | EN only | Stock photos, listicle format | "What is X" + "How to use X" | Rebranded (lost SEO equity), generic blog feel, no visual identity |
| GetSetUp | ~1M/mo | 45 | EN only | Video-first, Zoom-class format | Live classes with instructors | Requires scheduling, not self-paced, EN only, paywall for some |

### Tier 2: European / Non-English

| Site | Country | Language | Type | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| PapiMamieDigital.fr | France | FR | In-person classes (Rhone-Alpes region) | Not a content site. Physical training business. Tiny. |
| GransActius.org | Spain | ES/CA | Senior activity organization | One-off articles, not a guide library |
| Xataka/XatakAndroid | Spain | ES | Tech news + tutorials | Mass-market tech blog, not senior-focused |
| Swappie blog | EU | Multiple | Refurbished phone seller | Occasional senior tips as marketing content |
| emiliano.es | Spain | ES | Personal blog | One lawyer posting YouTube tutorials for his parents |

### Tier 3: What Does NOT Exist

**There is no dedicated, multilingual, senior-focused tech guide site anywhere in the world.**

Not in French. Not in Spanish. Not in Portuguese. Not in Italian. Not in German. Not in any combination.

The gap:
- US/UK have ~5 English-only options (all declining or pivoting)
- Europe has zero dedicated sites. Only scattered blog posts and physical training programs.
- No site offers the same guide in 5+ languages with native-quality content.
- No site targets the HELPER (35-55 year old child of the senior).

This is the gap Facil fills.

## Facil's Positioning

### One-Line Position
**The multilingual tech guide library for families helping seniors go digital.**

### The Statement
Facil.guide is not a tech site. It's not a blog. It's not a course platform.

It's a utility -- like a multilingual instruction manual that covers every common tech task a senior might need, written so simply that anyone can follow it, in their own language.

### Who We Are For (Priority Order)

1. **The Helper** (PRIMARY — 35-55 years old)
   - Adult children who are "tech support" for their parents
   - They Google "how to help my mom with iPhone" or "comment aider ma mere avec WhatsApp"
   - They find us, they send the link to their parent
   - They are the DISCOVERY engine. The senior is the USER.

2. **The Senior** (SECONDARY — 65+ years old)
   - The actual user of the guides
   - They arrive via a link from their child, or bookmark the site after first visit
   - They need: large text, simple language, clear steps, no distractions
   - They are the RETENTION engine. They come back.

3. **The Institution** (TERTIARY — libraries, telecoms, gov programs)
   - Digital literacy programs that need ready-made multilingual resources
   - Telecom companies onboarding elderly customers
   - Government digital inclusion initiatives (especially EU)
   - They are the REVENUE engine. B2B licensing.

### What We Are NOT

- Not a blog (no opinions, no news, no "top 10 lists")
- Not a course platform (no sign-ups, no progress tracking, no certificates)
- Not WikiHow (not general knowledge — strictly tech for seniors)
- Not a product review site (no affiliate-first content)
- Not a community (no forums, no comments, no user accounts)

We are a LIBRARY. Searchable, browsable, always available, always free.

## The Five Moats

### 1. Multilingual-First (Structural Moat)
Every guide exists in 5 languages from day one. No competitor does this. Translating 1,000 guides into 5 languages creates 5,000 indexed pages. That's 5x the SEO surface with no additional research cost. Each language opens an entire market with zero competition.

### 2. Helper-Focused Discovery (Audience Moat)
We target the searcher (helper), not the reader (senior). This means we rank for queries competitors don't even think about:
- "how to set up mom's new iPhone"
- "comment configurer telephone pour ma mere"
- "configurar movil para persona mayor"
Every competitor targets the senior directly. We target the person standing behind them.

### 3. Country-Specific Guides (Content Moat)
No one else writes guides for France Connect, SPID (Italy), Chave Movel Digital (Portugal), Cl@ve (Spain), MB Way, Doctolib, Bizum. These are zero-competition keywords with real demand. A French senior needs France Connect. WikiHow has nothing. GCFLearnFree has nothing. We will.

### 4. No-Friction Utility (UX Moat)
No accounts. No popups. No ads. No cookie walls. No newsletter begging. Just the guide, instantly, in your language. For a 75-year-old with shaking hands, every extra click is a wall. We have zero walls.

### 5. AI-Native Production (Cost Moat)
We produce guides at 10x the speed of a human editorial team at near-zero marginal cost. GCFLearnFree has a paid editorial staff. Senior Planet has AARP funding. We have an AI pipeline that produces native-quality content in 5 languages simultaneously. When we reach 500 guides x 5 languages = 2,500 pages, no funded competitor can match our output velocity.

## Visual Identity & Brand Position

### The Problem With Current Players

| Site | Visual Approach | Why It Fails |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| WikiHow | Hand-drawn illustrations | Iconic but becoming dated. Associated with "generic internet advice." Also: not accessible (small, cluttered) |
| TechLifeUnity | Stock photos | Zero brand recognition. Looks like every other blog. |
| Senior Planet | Stock photos of smiling seniors | Patronizing. "Look at the happy old person using a computer!" |
| GCFLearnFree | Minimal custom graphics | Clean but institutional. Feels like a government website. |
| GetSetUp | Video thumbnails | Cluttered, Zoom-class aesthetic. Intimidating for new users. |

### Where Facil Should Be

**Design philosophy: The IKEA of tech guides.**

IKEA instructions work because:
- No text needed (universal)
- Clean line drawings
- Step numbered clearly
- One action per illustration
- Consistent style across every product

Facil's visual brand should be:
1. **Clean, flat, diagrammatic illustrations** — not hand-drawn (WikiHow), not stock photos (everyone else), not fake screenshots
2. **Device-accurate but simplified** — an iPhone looks like an iPhone but without unnecessary detail. The button you need to tap is highlighted.
3. **Consistent color palette** — warm, approachable, high contrast (WCAG AA minimum). NOT corporate blue. NOT medical green.
4. **Numbered step indicators** — every illustration has a clear step number
5. **Arrow/highlight system** — red circles, arrows pointing to "tap here" — universal visual language
6. **Language-agnostic where possible** — illustrations should work across all 5 languages. Only text labels change.

### Proposed Color Palette

- **Primary**: Warm coral (#E8735A) — friendly, not corporate, high visibility
- **Secondary**: Deep teal (#2A6B6B) — trustworthy, calming
- **Background**: Warm white (#FAFAF7) — easier on aging eyes than pure white
- **Text**: Dark charcoal (#2D2D2D) — softer than pure black, less strain
- **Accent/Highlight**: Soft gold (#E8B84B) — for "tap here" indicators
- **Error/Alert**: Clear red (#D94040) — universal danger/attention

### Proposed Image Style

**FLUX.1-schnell generated, consistent prompt template:**

Style spec for every guide illustration:
- Flat vector style, clean lines, minimal detail
- Device shown at slight angle (3/4 view)
- Screen content simplified (only relevant UI elements shown)
- One action highlighted per image (finger tapping, arrow pointing)
- Warm background gradient (coral to white)
- Step number in a circle (top-left corner)
- facil.guide watermark (bottom-right, subtle)

This becomes our WikiHow-equivalent brand mark. When someone sees this illustration style, they know it's Facil.

### Why FLUX.1-schnell

- Runs locally on M4 Pro 24GB (free, no API costs)
- Best text rendering of any local model (critical for UI labels)
- 4-step generation = ~10 seconds per image
- Consistent style with locked prompt prefix
- Can generate ~500 images overnight in batch
- DrawThings (macOS native) as the runner — zero setup

### Image Pipeline (Proposed)

1. Each guide defines step images needed in frontmatter: `images: [step1, step2, step3...]`
2. Image prompt template: `{style_prefix} + {device} + {screen_content} + {action} + {step_number}`
3. Batch generate with DrawThings CLI mode
4. Output to `src/assets/guides/{slug}/step-{n}.webp`
5. Astro auto-optimizes at build time (WebP/AVIF, responsive sizes)
6. Same illustration works for all 5 languages (text labels are overlaid via CSS, not baked in)

**Critical detail**: Text labels on illustrations should NOT be baked into the image. Use CSS overlays so the same base image works across all languages. This means 34 base images per guide set, not 170.

## Open Questions for Middo

1. **Color palette** — coral/teal proposed above. Does this feel right or should we explore alternatives?
2. **Illustration test** — should I generate a proof-of-concept set (5 images for one guide) before committing to FLUX?
3. **German** — when to add DE as 6th language? Month 4 or earlier?
4. **B2B outreach timing** — start telecom conversations now (with 34 guides) or wait until 150+?
5. **Print PDF** — priority or nice-to-have?
6. **Helper dashboard** — build it or validate demand first?
