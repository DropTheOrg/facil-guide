## 1. Market Size: The Numbers

### 1.1 Senior Population in Target Countries (65+, 2024)

| Country | Population | 65+ Share | 65+ Population | 65+ Growth (10yr) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Italy | 58.9M | **24.3%** | **14.3M** | +2.1pp |
| Portugal | 10.3M | **24.1%** | **2.5M** | +2.8pp |
| France | 68.4M | **21.7%** | **14.8M** | +3.1pp |
| Spain | 48.6M | **20.4%** | **9.9M** | +1.8pp |
| UK (EN) | 67.7M | **18.8%** | **12.7M** | +1.5pp |

Source: Eurostat Demography 2025, Euronews analysis

**Total addressable market: 54.2M seniors in our 5 target language markets.**

Italy and Portugal have the highest elderly ratios in the EU. These are our strongest markets by demographic density.

### 1.2 The Digital Divide (Age-Based)

| Metric | 16-24 age | 65-74 age | Gap |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Daily internet use (EU, 2024) | 97% | ~72% | 25pp |
| Internet-connected device use (EU, 2025) | 84% | **45%** | 39pp |
| E-commerce usage | 78% | ~42% | 36pp |
| Generative AI usage (EU, 2025) | ~50% | ~12% | 38pp |

Source: Eurostat ICT Survey 2025, Euronews Sept 2025

**Key finding:** 45% of 65-74 year-olds use internet-connected devices vs 84% of young adults. That's 55% who don't -- and a large share of the 45% who do struggle with basic tasks.

### 1.3 Non-Users and Their Reasons (EU, 2025)

| Reason for not using internet | % of non-users |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| "Don't feel the need" | 3% of total pop |
| "Difficulty to use" | 2% of total pop |
| Accessibility/cost/security | <1% each |

The 2% who cite "difficulty to use" = ~9M people in the EU alone. That's our core audience -- people who WANT to use technology but find it too hard.

### 1.4 Country-Specific Digital Gaps

| Country | Never used internet (2025) | Mobile internet usage | E-commerce adoption |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Portugal | **~10%** | 89% | Below EU average |
| Italy | **~8%** | 92% (daily, only 92% vs EU 94%) | Below EU average |
| France | ~4% | 94% | Above EU average |
| Spain | ~5% | **95%** (top 5 EU) | Near EU average |
| UK | ~2% | 98% | Above EU average |

Source: Eurostat 2025

Portugal and Italy have the highest "never used internet" rates among our targets. Combined with their highest-in-EU elderly percentages, these are markets where facil.guide fills the biggest gap.

### 1.5 Device Usage Among Seniors

- **Smartphones are the #1 device** across all EU countries (89% of all users)
- Laptops: 56%, Desktop: 31%, Tablets: 31%
- Among 65-74: smartphones still dominate but tablet usage is higher proportionally
- **iPhone and Android guides are the highest-value content categories**

### 1.6 WhatsApp: The Senior Killer App

- 3.3 billion MAU globally (2025)
- **Dominant messaging app in all 5 target countries:**
  - France: 35M+ users
  - Spain: 38M+ users
  - Italy: 35M+ users
  - Portugal: 8M+ users
  - UK: 40M+ users
- WhatsApp is often the FIRST app seniors learn to use (family pressure)
- WhatsApp guides are our highest-intent content

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### 2.1 Direct Competitors

| Site | Language | DA | Content | Weakness |
|------|----------|-----|---------|----------|
| **TechBoomers / TechLifeUnity** | EN only | ~45 | 1000+ guides | English only. No multilingual. Outdated design. Rebranded. |
| **Oasis Connections** | EN only | ~35 | Courses, not articles | US-focused. Class-based (not searchable guides). No SEO play. |
| **Espace Seniors Numerique** | FR only | ~20 | ~200 guides | French only. Volunteer-run. Slow updates. |
| **Senior Planet** | EN only | ~40 | Articles + classes | US-focused. Not guide-structured. No schema markup. |
| **ICT4TheElderly** | EN only | ~15 | Project docs | EU-funded project, not consumer content. |

### 2.2 Our Competitive Edge

1. **5 languages from day one.** No competitor does this. TechBoomers = English only. Every French/Spanish/Portuguese/Italian senior searching in their language finds zero purpose-built competitors.

2. **SEO-first architecture.** HowTo schema, FAQPage schema, breadcrumbs, sitemap, fast static site. Competitors use WordPress with bloated themes and no structured data.

3. **Zero cost to operate.** Cloudflare Pages = free. Astro = static. No server. We can outlast any funded competitor because our burn rate is $0.

4. **DropThe data network behind it.** When we add movie/book recommendations, we have 200K+ movies with metadata. No guide site has a data layer.

5. **Content velocity.** 100 pages/night via AI + human review. TechBoomers hasn't updated in months.

### 2.3 Gap Analysis: What Nobody Does

| Feature | TechBoomers | Oasis | SeniorPlanet | **facil.guide** |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Multi-language | -- | -- | -- | **5 langs** |
| HowTo schema | -- | -- | -- | **Yes** |
| FAQPage schema | -- | -- | -- | **Yes** |
| Mobile-first | Partial | -- | Partial | **Yes, 48px touch** |
| WCAG AA | -- | -- | -- | **Yes** |
| Print stylesheet | -- | -- | -- | **Yes** |
| Free, no signup | Yes | No (account) | Partial | **Yes** |
| Static/fast | -- | -- | -- | **<100ms TTFB** |
| AI-generated + disclosed | -- | -- | -- | **Yes** |

## 3. Content Strategy

### 3.1 Content Pillars (Priority Order)

| Pillar | % of Content | Why | Example |
|--------|-------------|-----|---------|
| **WhatsApp guides** | 25% | #1 app seniors use. Highest search volume. | "How to send voice message on WhatsApp" |
| **iPhone guides** | 20% | Dominant smartphone among EU seniors (higher loyalty, more Google searches). | "How to make text bigger on iPhone" |
| **Security/scams** | 15% | YMYL content = high trust signal. Seniors are #1 scam target. | "How to recognize a scam email" |
| **Communication** | 15% | Video calls, email, messaging = why seniors go online. | "How to video call on WhatsApp" |
| **Android guides** | 10% | Large market but fragmented (Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.). | "How to install an app on Android" |
| **AI/new tech** | 10% | Growing curiosity (33% EU used GenAI in 2025). | "What is ChatGPT and how to use it" |
| **Lifestyle** | 5% | Movies, books, health apps. Future growth. | "Best streaming apps for seniors" |

### 3.2 Content Velocity Plan

| Phase | Timeline | Pages/night | Total pages/month | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Phase 1 (now) | Feb-Mar 2026 | 100 (20 EN x 5 langs) | 3,000 | 3,000 |
| Phase 2 | Apr-May 2026 | 100 | 6,000 | 9,000 |
| Phase 3 | Jun onwards | 50 (maintenance) | 1,500 | 10,500+ |

### 3.3 Language Priority (by market opportunity)

| Priority | Language | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | **French (FR)** | 14.8M seniors, 4% never-users, strong digital gap in rural areas, France has the EU's "Plan Numerique Inclusif" creating demand for resources |
| 2 | **Portuguese (PT)** | 2.5M seniors but **24.1% elderly ratio** (2nd highest EU) and **~10% never used internet** (highest among our targets). Least competitive language. |
| 3 | **Italian (IT)** | 14.3M seniors, **24.3% elderly ratio** (highest EU), only 92% daily internet (lowest among large EU nations). Massive underserved market. |
| 4 | **Spanish (ES)** | 9.9M seniors in Spain alone + 700M Spanish speakers globally (Latin America upside). 95% mobile internet = high smartphone guide demand. |
| 5 | **English (EN)** | Largest search volume but most competitive. TechBoomers, SeniorPlanet exist. We compete on schema + speed + freshness. |

### 3.4 Google AI Overview Filter

Before writing any topic, check if Google's AI Overview fully answers the query:
- **Skip:** AI Overview gives complete step-by-step (e.g., "How many GB is an iPhone")
- **Partial:** AI Overview gives basic answer but misses device-specific details (WRITE -- add value)
- **Gold:** AI Overview doesn't exist or is vague (WRITE -- we own this)

Senior tech queries often fall in "Gold" because AI Overview struggles with step-by-step visual UI descriptions.

## 4. SEO Strategy

### 4.1 Keyword Clusters (by search intent)

| Cluster | Pattern | Volume Signal | Competition |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| WhatsApp how-to | "comment envoyer [X] sur WhatsApp" | Very high | Low (FR/PT/IT) |
| iPhone settings | "comment [action] sur iPhone" | Very high | Medium |
| Scam recognition | "comment reconnaître arnaque [X]" | High | Low |
| App installation | "comment installer [app]" | High | Low |
| Basic device | "comment [basic action] [device]" | Very high | Low-Medium |

### 4.2 Schema Advantage

Our competitors have zero structured data. We have:
- **HowTo** on every guide (rich snippet with steps in SERPs)
- **FAQPage** on every guide with FAQ section (FAQ accordion in SERPs)
- **Product + Review** on product reviews
- **BreadcrumbList** on every page

This means Google can show our guides as rich snippets with expandable steps and FAQ -- taking significantly more SERP real estate than competitor plain-text results.

### 4.3 Technical SEO Status

| Factor | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| TTFB | <50ms (Cloudflare CDN) | 10/10 |
| Core Web Vitals | Static HTML, no JS frameworks | 10/10 |
| Mobile-first | Responsive, 48px touch targets | 10/10 |
| Schema markup | HowTo, FAQ, Product, Breadcrumb | 10/10 |
| Sitemap | Auto-generated, submitted to GSC | 10/10 |
| robots.txt | Clean (CF Content-Signal pending fix) | 9/10 |
| hreflang | TODO | 0/10 |
| Canonical | Yes, all pages | 10/10 |
| OG/Twitter cards | Yes, branded image | 10/10 |

**Priority fix: hreflang tags.** This is the #1 missing SEO element. Without hreflang, Google might see FR/EN/ES versions as duplicate content rather than translations. Critical for multi-language sites.

## 5. Backlink Strategy

### 5.1 Backlink Sources (by DA and difficulty)

| Source | DA | Type | Difficulty | Expected Links | Method |

| **Medium** | 95 | Cross-post | Easy | 5-10 | Publish "The digital divide in Southern Europe" data articles |
| **University partnerships** | 60-80 | Digital humanities projects | Hard | 5-10 | Contact EU-funded aging/digital projects (DIGITALIZE ME, eSeniors.eu) |

### 5.2 Backlink Campaigns (Execution Plan)

#### Campaign 1: Government Digital Inclusion Programs (Week 1-2)

Target: National digital skills initiatives that maintain public resource lists.

| Country | Program | URL | Contact Method |
|---------|---------|-----|---------------|
| France | France Num | francenum.gouv.fr | Resource submission form |
| France | PIX (digital skills) | pix.fr | Partnership email |
| Portugal | INCoDe.2030 | incode2030.gov.pt | Resource submission |
| Portugal | "We and Our Grandparents" | Local school partnerships | Email coordinators |
| Spain | Red.es / Digitaliza | red.es | Resource listing form |
| Italy | Repubblica Digitale | repubblicadigitale.innovazione.gov.it | Resource submission |
| EU | Digital Skills & Jobs Platform | digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu | Submit as "good practice" |
| EU | EPALE (Adult Learning) | epale.ec.europa.eu | Resource contribution |

**Pitch template (as Mike from DropThe):**
> We've built facil.guide, a free multilingual tech guide site for seniors available in French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. All guides include step-by-step instructions, FAQ sections, and are designed for accessibility (WCAG AA, 18px minimum text, 48px touch targets). We'd love to be included in your digital literacy resource list.

#### Campaign 2: Library & Senior Center Outreach (Week 2-4)

Target: Public libraries and senior centers with digital literacy programs.

- France: 16,000+ public libraries (bibliothèques municipales)
- Spain: 6,700+ public libraries
- Italy: 12,000+ public libraries
- Portugal: 2,000+ public libraries

**Strategy:**
1. Build a CSV of 200 largest city libraries in FR/ES/PT/IT
2. Find digital literacy coordinator emails
3. Send personalized email in their language
4. Offer printable PDF versions of guides (future feature, backlink incentive)

**Expected result:** 20-50 links from library resource pages (DA 30-60). These are high-quality, relevant, editorial links.

#### Campaign 3: Wikipedia Citations (Week 3-4)

Target articles to add facil.guide as external resource:

| Article | Language | Section | Justification |
|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Digital literacy | EN/FR/ES/PT/IT | External links | Free multilingual digital literacy resource |
| Digital divide | EN/FR/ES/PT/IT | External links | Addresses the elderly digital divide |
| Assistive technology | EN | External links | Senior-accessible tech guides |
| WhatsApp | FR/ES/PT/IT | External links (non-EN) | Localized usage guides |

**Rules:** Follow Wikipedia guidelines strictly. Cite as a genuine resource, not spam. Focus on non-English Wikipedias where resource sections are thinner.

#### Campaign 4: DropThe Cross-Linking (Ongoing)

Link from DropThe entity pages to facil.guide:
- Movie/series pages: "New to streaming? Learn how to set up Netflix" -> facil.guide
- Company pages (Apple, Google, WhatsApp): "Need help using [product]?" -> facil.guide
- Knowledge graph links: add facil.guide as a "resource" entity type

**Expected result:** 50-100 internal network links. Passes PageRank from DropThe (growing DA) to facil.guide.

#### Campaign 5: Technical Community (Week 1-2)

Same playbook as DropThe backlinks:

| Platform | DA | Article Topic |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Dev.to | 72 | "Building a multilingual Astro site for seniors: 0 to 87 pages in a day" |
| Hashnode | 65 | "Why I built a free tech guide site for my grandmother" |
| HuggingFace | 80 | Dataset: "Senior tech search queries by language" |
| GitHub | 98 | Already have public repo |

#### Campaign 6: Senior-Focused Media & Forums (Ongoing)
